Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>i am a motion picture production major at wright state university in ohio, and yesterday i was sadly given the opportunity to watch this god-awful film in class. we were informed by our professor that it would be very funny to us, but the reason we were watching it was because it was one of the first sound films - a complete disaster.the problem with early sound films was that hollywood actors only knew how to do silent movies and they weren't good at memorizing lines. so producers and directors would look to the stage to get actors. sounds like a great idea, right? well, the kind of acting one does on stage doesn't show up too well on film. most of the actors in 'atlantic' look and sound like they're acting in a play, which results in lots of hearty laughs at the over-acting. another limitation of early sound film was the technology of microphones. you couldn't move the mikes like you can today, you had to keep them static or it would pick up the sound of air moving through. there was usually one mike used in any given scene in this movie. in one particular scene, there is a man sitting at a table. someone walks right up to him and delivers their line, then walks away. another actor comes up from behind him, delivers their line, then walks away. it goes on like this for a couple more people. the microphone is obviously right by the man at the table, making for a laughable actor carousel.those are only technical problems. if you get into the story and direction, then it gets even worse. the story is a fictionalized account of what happened on the titanic. the characters are unbelievable and pointless. a 'story' about a man cheating on his wife and their teenage daughter has no place in the movie. it is barely resolved and leaves you wondering why it was there in the first place. a lousy attempt at high drama, the actors take long, pregnant pauses between lines many times. it is tiresome, and you can't wait for this 90 minute (feels like 180 at least) movie to get over with. i'm not going to talk a whole lot about the issue of racism at this time in our country, but it really offended me that there were only two blacks in the whole movie, and they were portrayed as animals. they both pushed past the women and children to try and get in one of the lifeboats. they were ordered to stop or be shot, and of course they didn't so they were shot. i was appalled.i give this movie a 2/10. i would have given it a 1/10 (the lowest rating possible), but i gave it an extra point just because it was one of the first sound films, and i tried to put it into context. if you want to see a good early sound film, check out alfred hitchcock's 'blackmail' that also came out in the year 1929. you will find that the best directors were able to adapt to new technology immediately.</review>",1,1,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-4e84c100-fc04-4d64-84d6-378a12b5b807', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746711927, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Based on the given review, the movie is highly negative, criticizing the movie\'s sound film technology, acting, direction, and storyline.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>at one point, violet (lucy liu) tells neil (cillian murphy) that why she constantly seeks out for an adventure. she said 'because i'm bore-phobic'. it mean that she can't really get on with her life by doing some mandatory activities. well, i think her reason and the way this film go is very ironic. because 'watching the detectives' is a cheer boredom. have any of these characters actually doing something exciting for once? neil is a geek who runs his own very small video rental shop. he and his other geek friends usually hang out around the shop and watching movies together while debating about them afterward. but neil's life is completely turned around when violet walks into his store. she's an eccentric woman who hides a little secret from him. anyway, after some dates, they decide to see each other. the problem is violet is a person who keep doing prank jokes on neil and can't really doing something normal, whereas neil is completely opposite to hers. the question is. is they are going to be in love at the end? you bet.'watching the detectives' is a clich√© romantic-comedy to its core. and they made it even worst by pretending to be something else. from the first couple of set-up, we know that neil is pretty laid-back guy who didn't really commit to anything. and then, violet enters the scene, looking all weird and annoying. so at this point, we all know that we're going to sit though all meaningless situations to find out how they're going to end up in the end. is it worth waiting for? i would say no.as i said, they tried to give something more for the audience. 'watching the detectives' is trying to talk about commitment. to observe how far people go to reach for something they desire. we knew in the end that insane things that violet has done is all the test how far neil is ready to go to win her heart (or whatever). well, i think it is completely bullshit. this movie will end pretty quick if neil just said to himself 'forget about it, that girl is one of a nutjob !' after collaborating with many great directors recently (danny boyle's 'sunshine' and '28 days later', ken loach's 'the wind that shakes the barley' and neil jordan's 'breakfast on pluto' to name a few), it's pretty weird choice for cillian murphy to make a movie with one of broken lizard comedy troop, paul soter. by all means, he's not bad (as usual), but such a talent actor like him shouldn't be wasting his time in the movie like this. on the other hand, lucy liu is dreadfully awful as violet. her acting is a mess. i mean it's all over the place and so over-the-top. tony montana would have been proud.the last but not least mistake that movie made is a completely irrelevant title. you simply can't really connect a dot between the plot and its title; and then you will end up thinking that it makes no sense at all. in short, 'watching the detectives' is pleasant if forgettable motion picture that you might have a chance to catch it on cable tv so quick that you couldn't imagine.bloodymonday rating: 1.5/4</review>",1,1,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-828c7a54-b28e-4144-9f7a-dfcef6bbe0f3', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746711928, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Based on the given review, the movie is negative.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>... i am left with little choice but to employ it at least once during the course of my review of respiro. among other things, what defines pretension is in my opinion a lack of emotional sincerity on the author's part. respiro seems made with an all too contrived and self-aware intent to be artistic, symbolic, spiritual, provocative, metaphorical... mythical, even. but luckily for all true artists out there, a predisposed formula to achieve artistic beauty and depth doesn't exist. stunning natural locations (yes, these remote parts of southern italy look exotic even to most other italians), pretty actors and some amusing, gutsy, spontaneous performances by a handful of attractive children won't elevate a substanceless movie beyond a pretty succession of images. yet this insincere and vain, and ultimately hollow movie aches to be art, succeeding only to a very limited extent, perhaps in some cases by accident. i'll admit that the conceptually pompous ending does have a certain visual poetry to it. however, it's my belief that this was achieved in ways that had more to do with the beauty of the lampedusa sea and the strong symbolic power of bathing and water (connecting it to so much that's mythical, mystical, religious, archetypical, etc) than with crialese's talent.valeria golino is gratingly histrionic and affected in her performance as grazia. for a mentally unstable woman from a humble and provincial background, she sure has a fashionable wardrobe. her flattering, floaty floral dresses and attractive, sun-kissed beach hair could have graced the pages of any vogue summer edition. the fact she was a 'nutcase' could in a way have been nothing but a fashionable addition to her trendy demeanour and look - that's how skin-deep her 'condition' seemed to me. golino's two-dimensional stereotype of the innocent, natural child-woman misunderstood and oppressed by her backward community was tiresome and irritating at worse, while leaving me unmoved and indifferent at best. i agree with the reviewer from london who wrote that mental illness is very badly served by cinema - during the course of the entire movie we never really get a sense of grazia's illness and have no idea what is actually wrong with her (other than her being a tiresome stereotype of a 'free spirit'). we don't know why she's given injections and is required to see a specialist in milan. this generic way of writing mental illness is one of the main tell-tale signs of the movie's overall shallowness.another fairly insulting aspect of respiro is the quaintification of its location. i struggled to figure out whether this movie was supposed to be set in the present day or the past, seeing as it aimed to make even an admittedly backward part of italy (by comparison) seem a dozen times quainter and more conveniently primitive than it actually is. again, this smacks of shallowness and a complete lack of sincerity on crialese's part. some non-italian viewers will gleefully lap up the picturesque backwardness, the clich√© of the possessive, macho italian man as if it were common-place, so keen will they be to continue viewing my country as one culturally stranded sometime in the 1950s (the question i'd like to ask david ferguson, the reviewer from dallas, texas is as follows: is your country's mentality stuck in the 1950s? no? ok, then why should mine be?). unfortunately for whoever still wishes to view italy in such an anachronistic way, that aspect of respiro is actually ridiculous and phoney even in the eyes of this italian viewer. the subtly incestuous tension between grazia and her eldest son was as tiresome and predictable as fabrizio bentivoglio's sexist-but-loving-husband routine. i especially loathed the scene in which grazia joins her husband and male friend in some man-to-man banter over a bottle of beer, to her husband's macho embarrassment and displeasure. according to this movie, it isn't a woman's place to take part in a man's conversations. ah, but our 'loveable' 'free-spirit' is too good for this place and doesn't understand the oppressive, unwritten rules of lampedusan patriarchy! not only does this scene depict something so fake, it should be enough on its own to discredit the entire movie's credibility. it also completely gets the wrong end of the stick of the culture it strives to depict, clearly showing that it was written without a clear understanding of the location or its population. i would challenge anyone who knows contemporary italy to say otherwise.for a truly accomplished contemporary italian filmmaker, one who in my opinion deserves to be listed among the greats of italy's glorious cinematic past (which alas, isn't the shadow of its former self!), look no further than gianni amelio - especially lamerica, cos√¨ ridevano and his latest, la stella che non c'√®. unlike most contemporary italian cinema, sadly derivative and stagnant, amelio's is a fresh and independently creative voice. despite my scathing review of respiro, i am now more than willing to believe that crialese's latest nuovomondo, now showing in italian cinemas, will be a worthwhile one. i therefore look forwards to enjoying it, though it won't be overly shocking to me if i don't (considering my feelings for respiro!).</review>",1,1,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-5466b922-4613-4c05-9be6-dc59d3e123f2', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746711932, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""This review is very negative.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>i think that elisabeth rohm, though she may try hard, is not very good at all. i guess it was because of budget that she may have been the only one they could get for that price. i mainly watched it for the performance of myron natwick, whose work i know very well.he was the most believable and without doubt the most compelling to watch. when he wasn't on the screen, the thing went dead. this was filmed in vancouver. he gave me the creeps, but be assured that in real life he is a kind, funny compassionate man. he even said playing that role gave him the creeps.i'll watch anything with him in it, but elisabeth rohm - never again. she was as exciting as lint on law and order. maybe a very nice person, but no actress.</review>",0,1,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-037f59ae-5650-4092-b91b-b582bf117b69', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746711938, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Based on the given review, the overall sentiment is negative.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>prot (kevin spacey) is a mental hospital patient who claims to be native to a distant planet called k-pax. his psychiatrist, dr. mark powell (jeff bridges) tries to help him, all the while trying to understand prot and find out if he is really from k-pax.this movie doesn't really fall into any particular genre. one big part of k-pax is drama/ science-fiction, another part fantasy, plus, add to that a dash of comedy and you begin to get what k-pax is all about. the story (as you see above) isn't too complicated or deep, but it still offers some good twists and turns of the plot that may still surprise you as they did me. no special effects or graphics accompany this movie, and there's no need to have them, the music in the film is great however. a techno soundtrack along with a terrific piano piece makes k-pax sound sci-fi and makes certain scenes intriguing.kevin spacey is the heart of the movie and plays a very convincing alien (prot) from the planet k-pax, emotional with great facial expressions, spacey does a fine job in the lead role. jeff bridges is dr. powell, that aids and attempts to understand prot. bridges is also excellent in his part. bridges and spacey fit together very well and they should, after all, they've both had a lot of experience. the wife of dr. powell is rachel powell, played by mary mccormack. mccormack plays her part well, showing the frustration from having her husband gone and so dedicated to his patient. alfe woodard plays dr. powell's coworker claudia villars, we don't really see claudia too much, but overall she puts in an alright performance.k-pax is rated pg-13 for 'a sequence of violent images, and brief language and sensuality', and that covers it. as far as 'violent images' go, we don't see too much. a few people that have quite a bit of blood on them, but that's all. language is as follows: 1 'f' word (wow, only one!), 11 's' words, and a few uses of the lord's name in vain. not too bad really. the 'sensuality' part is just from when prot explains to dr. powell how reproduction works on k-pax, nothing terrible, just something about it feels like 'having your nuts in a vice.' not too bad on the content level for a pg-13 movie, it could have been a lot worse.in conclusion, k-pax is not a bad movie. it won't stun you, but it is enjoyable and kind of fun to watch. it has some funny parts, sad parts, really sad parts, and, well you know what i mean. it's a story of a mental hospital patient, what do you expect? all in all a good rent for those of you looking for a good drama that you can kick back and relax to, k-pax is a well done movie.bonus! if you've seen this movie already, like it, and are thinking about getting the dvd, i would highly recommend it. it has loads of extras to look through, and even an alternate ending and deleted scenes. 8/10</review>",-1,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-e4fea4fd-a59f-4cf1-b562-36468ffb3001', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746711939, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""This movie seems to be a mix of science fiction and horror with a drama component.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>i just finished watching dressed to kill,which is written and directed by brian de palma.the dvd had both the'r' rated version and the unrated version.i chose the unrated version.since i have yet to view the 'r' rated version,i can't be completely sure of the difference.there is however a very graphic graphic female nudity including a scene of explicit expression of self gratification in this version.i guess you could call this scene soft core porn.if this sort of thing may offend you,i would suggest you view the 'r' rated version.but i digress.any comment from here on refers to the unrated version.this is a murder mystery/ psychological horror/suspense movie.there is very little violence and blood.there is however one death sequence of note.the act of the killing itself is fairly graphic.however the blood it self does not look real.it is reminiscent of how a 70's slasher film would look.i believe this is done deliberately to offset the violence of the act itself,to give the scene a low budget feel.most of the violence,or rather possibility of such,is implied.the film is very well paced.as far as i can tell every scene had a purpose,which i find very rare when compared to many of today's films. anyway,i also thought the acting was good,especially angie dickinson.and micheal cane turns in a quietly understated performance in his role,which works brilliantly in this case.the movie also has one great twist in it,in my mind,although some people might find it predictable.the only complaint(and it's really more of an observation)i have is that i thought the character played by nancy allen could have been fleshed out more,especially considering she has a fair amount of screen time.but i think she does a good job with what she is given.and this doesn't really take away from the quality of the film.the film also has a strong moral to it,which is even more relevant today.but the movie doesn't hit you over the head with it.i also really liked the musical score,composed by pino dinaggioi felt it was very similar to the music in the original psycho.to me,this music really elevated the movie.i thought this movie was brilliant.for me,dressed to kill(1980)is 10/10</review>",0,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-d2d1bc4c-1d41-4cfb-b754-d07ea743ff1a', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746711987, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Based on the content of the review, the overall sentiment appears to be mixed, with some positive elements and some negative points.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>gone with the wind is one of the most popular books ever printed . it is by far the movie of all movies . the romance between scarlett and rhett made people dream all over the world and turned the lead actors into cinematographic icons . one can ask , is it really necessary to make a sequel ? and ... there are some big shoes to fill .well , there was the book first . 'scarlett' by alexandra ripley is , we have to admit , well-written and fully respecting the world created by margaret mitchell . she picks up exactly where we left our heroine previously and gently leads us from mitchell's heritage into her own fantasy . in the book scarlett , defeated after melanie's death and rhett's leaving , travels to charleston to reside with her mother-in-law in hope of regaining rhett's love . her typical manipulative behavior evokes once again a lot of criticism from rhett and drives them further apart ... until a certain boat trip that will change everything . scarlett now carries a secret . the series follows the book quite accurately until the arrival of scarlett in ireland . from then of , book and series slowly split ways . the actual end differs , but of course the both have scarlett and rhett back together .the production of the series was announced with a worldwide search for the next scarlett o'hara . many countries made their own television shows featuring young actresses auditioning for the part . eventually , about twelve girls were chosen to participate in the final screen tests and interviews in atlanta , georgia . unfortunately , the producer found no scarlett amongst these actresses . sad for the girls , major publicity for the show ( it was already sold to many television stations worldwide before shooting even had started ). robert halmi , the producer who bought the rights to 'scarlett' , told he discovered the right actress while watching tv , gave her a call and two days later signed the deal . joanne whalley-kilmer ( who starred in'willow' and 'scandal' , the latest being the movie robert halmi was watching that faithful evening )is not vivien leigh , but she certainly is scarlett ! her performance is not a copy of leigh's , she makes the character her own . the major difference between gwtw and 'scarlett' is the fact the lead character evolves and grows as a person . this is the series prerogative , why copying something that has been done before ? considering there is a gap of almost seventy years between the first and second storyline , it is natural that both authors emphasize on different aspects of the characters . whereas mitchell works around scarlett dealing with the consequences of the civil war and fighting for tara , ripley lets scarlett face her demons . this to me , is the most interesting aspect of the series , we get to know scarlett in a different way as she learns that not everything can always go the way she wants . i totally agree with the choice of timothy dalton as rhett butler . he portrays him with charm and irony and is less of a cardboard figure than clark gable's performance . the rest of the cast was well chosen . julie harris is endearing as rhett's mother , john gielgud gives a very amusing performance as grandfather robillard and sean bean is always at his best playing a dirty character , his lord fenton makes no exception . poor choices however with stephen collins as ashley and ann-margret's adaption of belle watling was a waste of money . costumes , sets and locations are elaborate and convincing . the newly built tara set looked exactly the same and it is a moving sequence in the series when the house appears for the first time .is there a point in making a sequel ... well , six hours of romance are to me . one to watch !</review>",0,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-07d06c2e-ab33-41ea-8657-c40f119be3f6', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746711991, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'This review is very positive.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>i don't understand why people would praise this garbage. its wrong , stupid , unrealistic , awful , and just about everything else. the film is a view on life , racial issues , prejudice , and everything else that strangely goes on in college. this is where it fails. it has no grasps on reality. from many questionable non-sense scenes in the movie such as for examplea black man chasing down a white man with a gun, the black man and stopped by the security guards handcuffed and carried out while the gunman runs right past them.the same white man snipering down people from a roof topic which is stopped and beaten down by the same black man is then stopped and given a rodney king style beating while the gun man runs free while a moment later being chased back down by only one of the four guards.as one previous reviewer pointed out several white 230lbs men being beaten down by several black men weighing around 160lbs including the 105lbs bust a rhymesanother critical flaw in the film are the shallow uninteresting main characters. from the scared and confused white people and the mean , angry , and yet rightful (?) black people. its almost as its an insult to both black and white people. i am a white male and i know many black and hispanic people who agree that this movie is wrong to portray characters and giving them those characteristics exclusively due to their race.the storyline which i will explain now revolves around three characters. one a black athlete , the other a confused scared white girl who questions her sexuality , and the third is a white man who is also confused and scared , then blames his problems on black people in which he becomes a nazi later in the film. they all have their share of problems and adventures including sex , rape , fights , love , hate , prejudice , racial war , and oh yeah don't forget education. which all comes down at the end for the fatal shoot out. in which after they go back to their boring lives and think 'being white is bad'. does this sound alot like your college years? didn't think so. i don't think the director attended college especially if he were to make this awful mess.overall this is a really bad , bad , ugly movie. if you want to see a more accurate view or racial issues go see american history x. if you want to see a more accurate view of college rent porkys. just avoid this mess.</review>",1,1,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-0e71db20-ed7a-48cb-b8a7-931ce2e00259', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712020, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""The movie is a critique of the film's content, language, and subject matter.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>the role of economics in the industrialized north american market must have always been theorized in the homelands of the engines creation. persons and industrialist such as mercedes benz and the bavarian motor works (bmw) surely realized the opportunity of the north ameircan market with the purchase of fuel and number of automobiles purchased per household. this type of economic phenomena sparked the concept of speed racer.after the new constitution of japan the industrialization of the isolated island nation of japan must seek opportunity once again via economic partnerships with its global neighbors. this also helped spark the economic opportunities in the european and north american market if not the global market.speed is a young avid driver who without knowing any better is driven by his demanding father pops racer who has challenged himself his whole life to make a better machine better at winning races. it was in fact pops racer who drove his first son rex racer to the brink of destruction with his strategy of how to best use the technology he developed. as a mature racer, rex, finally realizes his own inherent values and becomes independent but still feels obligated to his younger bother speed.the exact relationship of rex racer to persons such as the inspector are never really clear, but put into dramatization. rex is eventually accused of being a type of agent for a country or organization due to his ability to be in places at times when there is no other explanation to how he would have known speed was in trouble. or the fact that the situations involved some types of illegal activity were his secretive knowledge is leveraged against an evil plot. this brings a level of cloak and dagger romance to speed racer.the mixture of speeds innocence with trixy, sprital, and chim chim brings a level of comic human nature. this concept is a good form of rhetoric to balance the themes and plots as they are played out from episode to episode. so, instead of a dry detective story the thrill of international race car driving, romance of cloak and dagger, and comedy of human nature is put into one story, speed racer.</review>",0,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-0eab53a5-cc7d-4698-afeb-7b165efa5cf4', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712053, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Based on the content of the review, the overall sentiment seems positive.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>despite its pedigree, the most interesting things about this series are not the animatronics or puppetry, which, while charming, are little more than sideshows, at least in the story i saw, a story short. in fact, loathe though i am to admit it, the programme's chief pleasure lies in that most ancient art, storytelling.john hurt, in rowley birken qc-mode, grotesque, medieval make-up, relates a story about story telling, seated by the fire, accompanied by a cynical dog. one winter's day, starving and poor, he spots a fellow beggar thrown out of the royal kitchen by the nasty cook. the story teller tricks this latter into giving them an excellent soup. furious, the cook pleads with the king for permission to boil the villain, but, pleased with the story teller's wit, the monarch offers him a reprieve - for 100 nights, he must tell the king a new story: if he fails to do so, he will hand him over to the cook.the story may be old, but it's told with great gusto. anthony minghella's script is excellently dramatic (as befits a playwright), witty, and with some disturbing concerns beneath the fun, such as fears for the self, or the culturally self-generating power of storytelling, linked to the continuation of ideological power. for a programme aimed at children, it is bracingly self-reflexive (with little nonsense about film being the new oral culture); despite the americanised style, there is a charming sense of medieval bustle, its grotesqueness and arbitrary terror, as well as its magic and power.</review>",0,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-3964e2b7-a8c7-494e-84ad-e2e6a217f475', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712055, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Based on the content of the review, the sentiment is negative.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>this is one of the finest films to come out of hong kong's 'new wave' that began with tsui hark's 'zu: warriors of magic mountain'. tsui set a tone for the new wave's approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the new wave (jackie chan, sammo hung, wong jing, ching siu tung, etc.) accepted from then on as a given; namely, the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony, if not outright comedy. 'burning paradise' put a stop to all that, and with a vengeance.it's not that there isn't humor here; but it is a purely human humor, as with the aged buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw. but this is just as humans are, not even buddhist priests can be saints all the time.when irony is at last introduced into the film, it is the nastiest possible, emanating from the 'abbot' of red lotus temple, who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before. he is the very incarnation of milton's satan from 'paradise lost': 'better to rule in hell than serve in heaven!' and if he can't get to satan's hell soon enough, he'll turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule.that's the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here: it's not that the abbot just wants to kill people; he wants them to despair, to feel utterly hopeless, to accept his nihilism as all-encompassing reality. thus there's a definite sense pervading the red temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the temple itself - it has become all there is to the universe, and the abbot, claiming mastery of infinite power, is in charge.of course, fortunately, the film doesn't end there. though there are losses, the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails. (if you want to know how, see the film!) yet there is no doubt that, in viewing this film, we visit hell. hopefully, we do not witness our own afterlives; but we certainly feel chastened by the experience - and somehow better for it over all.</review>",-1,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-e6952167-bc03-422e-b56d-c26747f3f30c', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712056, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""This film is one of the finest films to come out of Hong Kong's New Wave, which began with Tsui Hak's 'Burning Paradise.'

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>this is a clever and entertaining film about the backroom battling that went on to choose a successor to johnny carson on the tonight show. however, the movie's ultimate thesis, that david letterman's superior comedic talents were overlooked because of his controversial nature, and the show diminished by the enthronement of an inferior jay leno in the leading comedy program on television is simply untrue, as anyone who has watched both leno and letterman perform can see for themselves. the hard and simple truth is exactly as one nbc exec stated in the film 'jay leno is the funniest man in america.' and david letterman is not. once you realize this, then much of the machinations in the film become irrelevant. ultimately, the whole film amounts to little more than sour grapes by letterman fans, who just cannot accept that the better comic was chosen by people whose business it is to know these kind of things. the final proof is that despite letterman's early lead, possibly because of the hype that emerged from the battle for tonight show succession, leno's show has consistently proved to be the more popular, thus, in my mind at least, refuting letterman's claims to be unfairly robbed of his rightful inheritance.</review>",-1,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-ec8bcaa1-8830-4d6d-9301-5541a2db8ded', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712118, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'The movie is a satire of the American entertainment industry and its representation of what is happening in the entertainment industry.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>it is always a well-known, and important directorial device to set up the atmosphere of a film within the first 5 minutes. in the crucial opening scenes, the film should assert itself and make the viewers take notice and get interested in the rest of the film. here, in 'mute witness', we find a prime example of this.*scene spoiler* in the first 5-10 minutes, the film opens to a very hitchcockian scene of a pretty blonde lady in her apartment, with the radio on. she's wandering around, applying lipstick, dolling herself up, and ignoring the news report of a serial killer on the loose. of course, the serial killer is in her house, and monitoring her moves, knife in hand. she hears a noise, looks in a room, and there is her partner in a pool of blood. at the very point of her screams, she turns around to be faced with the knife-wielding maniac, who stabs her repeatedly in a brutal and horrifying act.......then something odd happens. as the woman convulses in her death throes, the killer sits down and takes out a cigarette to watch his victim perish. before he finds his lighter, his cigarette is lit...from someone else in the room! the camera pans out, and we realise that there are more and more people in the room, some taking notes, some filming, some recording the death, and that the lady is taking an awfully long time to die, and making a very hammy job of it too. when the audience realises what's going on, and the whole scene is part of a film, the suspenseful and horrific scene takes on an element of humour.*end scene spoiler* i have highlighted this opening scene for several reasons. firstly, it portrays the atmosphere of the whole movie perfectly. a thriller in the style of hitchcock or de palma, with some very disorientating, and even blackly humorous moments. - it conveys a central subject matter (that of the difference between a 'movie screen death' and a 'snuff film death', an issue which is elaborated on later in the film), and finally, it introduces the viewer to the characters, all as silently as possible.the plot of mute witness centres around billy hughes, an american special effects make-up artist who is working on the set of the film, being shot in a large warehouse in moscow. billy cannot speak, but she communicates in sign language through her sister. after the end of an evening's filming, billy inadvertently finds herself locked in the warehouse by accident, and in her attempt to escape, is witness to two of the crew making what first appears to be a porno film, but turns out to be a snuff movie. suddenly, her escape from the warehouse is a matter of life and death.without doubt, the first half of the film is powerful and absolutely gripping. billy's saving grace, and her handicap is the fact that she isn't able to utter a sound. (in fact, in my opinion, one of the best aspects of the film is the fact that it isn't chock-full of women screaming). there are some utterly disturbing moments, and some superb set-pieces of real suspense (the corridoor, and the elevator shaft are perfect examples). the timing is fluid, and the whole first half is an incredibly satisfying experience in itself.the second half of the film introduces new concepts. while there are still several suspenseful moments, the focus is on plot twists. new characters are introduced, and it is ambiguous as to whose side they are on. while there is nothing wrong per se with the second half of the film, it just doesn't quite measure up to the first half. there are some neat moments of black humour that perfectly juxtapose and punctuate some very dramatic scenes, but there are also some very lame comedy moments (coming specifically from billy's sister and her fianc√©e, who happens to be the director of the movie billy is working on), that almost ruin the film, just because they are badly misplaced and/or mistimed and ruin the pace. - at the end, the twists keep coming at a rapid-fire speed, and the climax of the film is, appropriately, as tense as the first half.there are several things that really make the movie work. the barriers of communication that billy must face, both as a mute, and as an american in moscow, mean that even an emergency call for help becomes a dangerous situation. the actress that plays billy, natasha zudina, does a wonderful job in the film, with an engaging on-screen prescence, and a brilliant performance, and finally, the direction as a whole, but most particularly in the first half of the film, which truly is a study in alfred hitchcock's suspense/thriller film techniques.as i have already said, though, the let-downs in the film are from some terrible comic relief moments that really do not need to be added. there is already a consistent and effective streak of dark humour that appears in the film without the need for the characters of karen hughes and andy clarke (the sister and the moviemaker) to turn their scenes into some unusual sit-com. however, despite these shortcomings, the film is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller, and ideal for a group viewing at halloween.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>one of the most popular rentals at my local video store is not borat or the departed but a 2005 documentary about jesus christ called the god who wasn't there by director brian flemming, an ex-christian fundamentalist. flemming, in his 62-minute documentary, asserts that jesus was not a historical figure but a legend based solely on pagan traditions. using interviews with authors, philosophers, and historians to debunk the long-held christian belief that jesus, the son of god, lived among men, was crucified, and was resurrected, flemming compares the christ story with those of cult figures isis and osiris in egypt, dionysus and adonis in greek mythology, and roman mystery cults such as mithraism and finds many surprising similarities.in addition to his evidence about pagan cults, he also states that the earliest sources for the christ story, the four gospels, were written forty or fifty years after the date given for jesus' crucifixion and that the letters of st. paul show little evidence of jesus being a flesh and blood figure. flemming, unfortunately however, is not out to conduct a solid investigation of the truth about jesus' life but to use the subject only as a point of departure for a full throttle attack on christianity and all religion. most of the interviews are with those philosophically aligned with the director including avowed atheists such as biologist richard dawkins and author sam price. the only christians interviewed are those on the fringe such as scott butcher, the creator of the website rapture letters.com, and ronald sipus, principal of the fundamentalist village christian school, which flemming attended as a boy.like michael moore's interview of charlton heston in bowling for columbine, his interview with sipus is so contentious that sipus walks out in the middle. in a sarcastic tone, flemming tells us how wrong christianity was wrong about the sun revolving around the earth, then points to atrocities committed in the name of christianity such as those by cult leader charles manson who killed 11 people and dena schlosser, who cut her baby's arm off for god. he also lifts a statement from a book by lahaye and jenkins that says that christians 'look forward to the day when all non-christians are thrown into a lake of fire, howling and screeching.' to further turn us against christianity, flemming shows us extended clips from mel gibson's the passion of the christ, detailing in minute detail each scene of violence and torture. what could have been a serious discussion on a very interesting subject eventually becomes a childish rant and a polemic against all religion. in the process of condemning those who used christianity to commit unspeakable acts, he ignores such people as socialist muriel lester, a famous christian pacifist, rigoberta mench√∫ tum, a mayan indian of guatemala who helped found the revolutionary christians and received the nobel peace prize in recognition of her work for social justice, and mother teresa, whose work was about respect for each individual's worth and dignity.his most telling argument is his comparison of christian doctrine with the pagan cults and he makes some good points, yet flemming does not tell us that while some aspects of these cults may resemble christian doctrines, there are no texts or source materials for these cults before 300ad, long after the new testament. also it is important to note one major difference. the immediate goal of the initiates was a mystical experience that led them to feel they had achieved union with their god. this is anathema to christianity which believes that a church hierarchy including priests and bishops all the way up to the pope are required to interpret god's will to mankind.although i am not a christian and have some doubts about whether or not jesus christ was in fact a historical figure, the truth is that, in the long scheme of things, it may not matter. what matters is that a message was introduced to mankind and spread around the world that contributed to mankind's spiritual evolution. regardless of the distortions and crimes later committed in its name and there were many, christianity as conceived was a doctrine of compassion and love, and a moral and ethical code that furthered respect for our fellow man.while i applaud the fact that the film was made and that a taboo topic was discussed, what is sorely needed is not another divisive attempt to use religion as a field of combat but to see it as a common thread that can bring the world's people together. while there is room for debate and discussion on religious subjects, in the words of annie besant, 'spiritual truths are best seen in the clear air of brotherhood and mutual respect. the god who wasn't there is recommended only for those whose idea of a good time is to trash the religion of others.</review>",-1,1,"{'id':

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>when a movie shocks you with it's disturbing, brooding atmosphere, and grabs you by the throat with it's stunning cinematography, you just know that you have stumbled upon a treat, masterpiece of a film. although with most modern movies, extremely enjoyable as some are, those that really shock you into focus are the strongest, and are the ones that are most critically acclaimed and mostly, stick with you for a life time. i say, proudly, that i am a fan of movies that disturb, not just horror movies, but those that send a vibe laden with foreboding. movies like breakdown and the missing, that send a chill down your spine, making you think 'holy crap, that could happen to me', and visually entice you, are up there with some of my favorite aspects in a movie. because i am only 21, i did not grow up with actors like burt renyolds, jon voight and ned beatty, albeit i am familiar with them, i didn't watch them grow and proceed as actors, as opposed to actors now like shia labouf and justin long. i must say, after the long hype and witnessing deliverance for the first time, i was so admired by these veteran actors in a movie made more than 30 years ago, and still lives it's terror up in competition to modern movies. burt renyolds plays lewis, the macho self appointed leader of a group of four friends on a canoe trip down a fictitious river before a dam is made, filling the whole wilderness in water. renyolds' character is an experienced adventurer, sort of no nonsense, and filled with machismo. witnessing him portray the tough guy, made me think differently about him as an actor, as i have only seen him as a seedy old guy or an angry politician. the dialog the director provides for his character gives him enough malice to be proved as a strong and even intimidating leader. ronny cox and ned beatty play as the novice adventurers, drew and bob respectively, joining in for the fun of a canoe trip. the actor that i thoroughly enjoyed watching was jon voight, once again i have only seen him as an older actor, however, unlike renyolds, i have quite liked voight's acting (and i don't regard anaconda when i say that), for example the national treasure movies. voight plays ed, whom, like lewis, is experienced in adventuring but is seen as a more reserved character, a reluctant hero/ leader and definitely lacks lewis' machismo. the film basically opens up with the four driving into a small town while asking to find someone to drive their cars to the bottom of the river whilst they canoe the rapids and camp along the riverside. you immediately get a creepy vibe from the hillbilly characters we are introduced to, like the imbred kid who plays the infamous 'duelling banjo's' at the start of the film with ronny cox's character drew; and more so the two mountain men in the films pivotal and disturbing rape scene. as with all atmospheric movies, from this moment on, dread and confusion fills the characters as well as the audience and it is here we see the characters take shape and change form. the canoe trip that follows is expertly shot and it is from here the men fight against both human and nature's odds for survival. the film's cinematics do not let up, and i back that comment up with the scene in which ed fights one of the rapist mountain men with a composite bow. as ed falls on to one of his arrows and notices his enemy approaching him, cocks his rifle, only to shoot the floor as he falls with an arrow in his neck; was possible the greatest piece of cinematic shooting i have seen in a film. in wrapping up, deliverance is one film, who's dread and atmosphere carry the mood across and to this date, remains one of the best films in cinematic history.</review>",0,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-a3276c8b-d292-4881-a949-e4f0c5645a70', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712188, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Based on the provided review, the overall sentiment of the movie seems to be positive, with the reviewer praising the actor Jon Voight\'s acting, especially his portrayal of Jon Voight as a more reserved and reluctant hero/leader, and the director\'s choice to use the familiar ""National Treasure"" films to introduce the viewer to the characters.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>the only good either of the problem child films caused was bringing together amy yasbeck and the late john ritter. aside from that, the flicks are as demonic as their hero. in this basically unnecessary sequel, freshly separated ben (ritter) and his little hellraiser junior (michael oliver, who never needs screen-time ever again) move to a new town infested with willing bachelorettes. ben eventually picks lawanda (played by the most underused original snl-er laraine newman), whose blanche dubois tendencies don't suit junior in the least. to add on to junior's torture, it seems this town already has a little firestarter in younger girl form with trixie, who coincidentally has a sweet, single mother played by yasbeck, the same actress who played junior's first horrible mother-through-adoption. you can see where the plot goes from here. searching for my favorite scene is like pulling teeth, so i guess i'll go with the 'cherry bomb in the toilet' gag that makes back to the future's james tolkan one of the many grown-up victims (that guy's always playing school authority figures). jack warden and gilbert gottfried return as their parts from the first film, but sadly, there is no appearance from the bow-tie klansma- er, i mean killer (michael richards) that made problem child all the more fun. on a serious note, i'm sure these films, whether abusive parents saw them or no, did wonders for the red-headed children of america. let us also salute these proud american flicks for their terrific promoting of adoption. oh, and dog poop jokes - gotta have dog poop jokes.... shmucks.</review>",0,1,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-b38513db-9ee9-48c9-af97-cee8375a59a2', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712196, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Based on the content of the review, the overall sentiment is positive.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>after the superfriends and scooby doo left the saturday morning airwaves in the fall of 1986, i pretty much stopped watching saturday morning cartoons at that point since those were the only two that kept me tuning in. and since neither the real ghostbusters nor the flintstone kids seemed very promising to me, i 'retired' and started sleeping in on saturday mornings. i only returned to saturday morning tv in 1988 for that one year only for one and only one animated show. a new animated show of superman was something i was not going to pass up. i was 17 and in high school at the time, but so what! i loved this show. from what i can recall, this series was a gift to fans i suppose in celebration of superman's 50th birthday that particular year. it had the theme music and the music style reminiscent of john williams movie score from the richard donner/christopher reeve superman movies. i honestly felt that the animation style ruby spears did was reminiscent of the super powers team: galactic guardians series by hanna barbera a few years before. sadly, danny dark was not back as superman, but i felt beau weaver did a very impressive job as the voice of superman and his clark kent was nerdy like the chris reeve version. after hearing him as reed richards/mr. fantastic on the 90's fantastic four, i could still see this version of superman in my mind. ginny mcswain as lois lane. lol! what a rhyme. she was a voice director for hanna barbera and ruby spears and i guess she took it upon herself to do lois. memories of the superfriends lingered in this series when it came to the voice over cast. jimmy olsen is mark taylor, who on the superfriends was formerly firestorm. perry white is none other than former batman tv writer stanley ralph ross, who on superfriends was gorilla grodd and brainiac in the super powers shows. and lex luthor, now a wise cracking billionaire tycoon is none other than superfriends voice alum, michael bell, whom i know best as zan and the riddler as well as many other characters on many other series. i felt this series was a combination of the movie superman along with the post crisis john byrne re envision of superman, with lex luthor as a billionaire tycoon, jonathan and martha kent being alive to see clark as superman. the bruce timm series and lois and clark would also do this. unfortunately, we never saw brainiac, bizarro, toyman, metallo, or darkseid. other than luthor, we saw only the prankster and we did see general zod. i especially enjoyed that one episode with wonder woman, who was voiced over by bj ward who played her on the super powers team as well. the episodes were smashing and i also enjoyed clark's growing and development stories from infancy to childhood to adolescence to an adult moving to metropolis in the short little segment, superman's family album. the only two things i didn't like. it only lasted one season. and after wonder woman's guest spot, i was hoping batman would turn up voiced over by adam west (still thinking about the super powers team episodes i guess). i also hoped for it because on the prankster episode, the metropolis baseball team was pitted against the gotham goliaths. every popular super hero has one cartoon series that is ultra rare. for spiderman, i feel it's the 1981 solo series that aired the same time as amazing friends. for the incredible hulk, it's the 1982 cartoon. for the fantastic four, it's the 1978 series with herbie the robot. for batman, it's the new adventures of batman 1977 by filmation featuring batmite. but for superman, the rarest series is this one. superman books and documentaries never cover or mention it. this is another series that wb should consider for dvd release. all in all, this 1988 version of superman is well....super!!</review>",0,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-de85b251-3893-4a8b-a241-e53f20e0ff58', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712218, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Based on the given review, the overall sentiment of the movie is positive and enthusiastic.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>the sitcom 'the league of gentlemen' follows the lives of several bizarre inhabitants of the fictional village 'royston vasey'. the different scenes are linked together by their common setting.in the first series, a sketch show, the main plot deals with a new road which is going to be built through royston vasey. consequently, more foreigners visit the small town. but edward and tubbs, the owners of a 'local' shop, which is actually far away from the town, do not like foreigners. whenever a visitor enters their shop, they kill him. in my opinion some scenes are kind of tasteless and not funny at all, for example, when the couple absorb two engineers who want to build the new road. edward drums, while tubbs is dancing half naked around the victims. moreover pauline lives in royston vasey. she works at the local job centre. although pauline hates the people she has to work with, the woman does not want to loose her job. so when an unemployed man gets an interview as fireman, she does not allow him to go because he is not ready for the job yet.then there is barbara dixton, a transsexual taxi driver who goes into great detail about 'her' sexual conversion.furthermore the vet, mr. chinnery, always kills animals instead of curing them. in one case, he comes to a farm and is leaded into the sitting room, where a dog lays in his basket. the farmer goes outside. on the assumption that the dog is the sick animal, mr. chinnery euthanizes him. a second later, the farmer opens the door, holding the 'real' sick animal, a sheep, in his hand.some more inhabitants are a husband and his wife who are visited by their nephew (his friend is killed by the shop owners, by the way). the couple is very tidy. they have, for example, towels in different colours. each colour stands for one part of the body. besides, they have thousands of keys, marked with different colours and precisely classified.in my opinion, the actors play very well. by playing women, the scenes become comical. the costumes are suited to the actors, too. tubbs is wearing a scarf and some crazy characters, for example edward, have unappetizing black teeth. the show has a great deal of dark humour, typical british. the set design reflects the mood of the series. the village and all the houses look grey and are decayed. around the local shop there is often fog which strengthens the threatening effect. even the village sign is ominous: 'welcome to royston vasey. you will never leave.'although i think that the actors do a great job, this type of series is not my taste.</review>",1,1,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-eeb1102c-4421-4c9c-aef6-f11ba35daf03', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712223, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Based on my analysis of the movie review, I would give this movie review a Negative sentiment.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>i'll admit that i've never seen 'waiting for guffman', 1997's critically acclaimed comedy mockumentary about a small town thats that stages a pageant. when the advertising for best in show had the tagline 'from the team that brought you waiting for guffman', a fair number of critics out there implied in their reviews that only people that are familiar with the film or its filmmakers and cast would have a good time seeing this film. for shame, critics, for shame times two! any critic that implies something like that with any film probably doesn't want to share the film's wealth with the rest of the world, but this is one film that i hope people will experience, now that its video/dvd. 'best in show' is, without a doubt, the best comedy of 2000.the film begins with a mockumentary style, introducing the main competitors (not to mention screwballs) of the annual mayflower 'best in show' competition, where dogs of all breeds come to compete to see who is the top dog. we have the loveable and gullable harry pepper (guest) with his bloodhound, the simple gerry & cookie fleck (levy & o'hara) with their terriors, nut-case yuppies hamilton & meg swan (hitchcock & posey), the gay dog groomers scott dolan & stefan vanderhoof (higgins & mckean), and the airheaded millionare sheri ann ward cabot (coolidge) along with her trainer christy cummings (lynch). they all have their minds on one simple object: the blue ribbon, which will be awarded to the best dog. and...do i have to tell you the rest?director/writer/star guest's idea of humor is one that assures me that there are comedies out there that are worth laughing at, and that the idiocy of films like 'american pie' or other pointless 'teenage' flicks won't take over the world after all. his idea is simple: make your comedy not just funny, but smart funny. but instead of following in the brilliant footsteps of films like 'zero effect' and 'high fidelity', he used a rather unusual approach (and as i understand, he also used this approach for 'guffman'). whether you notice or not, a very large part of the film is improvisation. in other words, what the actors say and do were probably not written in the script, maybe even not even dreamed of by guest and co-writer/star levy. but with a gentle hand from guest, he and the actors pulled off a hilarious theatrical feat that probably would have flopped if handled by other, less adept actors. now that's smart!the cast is, of course, what makes improv work the most. all of them are a (comedic) marvel to behold, especially guest as pepper. but the real standout has to be fred williard as buck laughlin, the clueless announcer at the competition who can spin out the most outrageously funny stories and comments that no announcer would even dream of...that is, if the announcer was trying to be funny. williard can go from talking about the dog to suddenly going on and on about how much he can bench press. there's even a part were he gives out an idea for a new marketing strategy: have sexy women pose in tight shirts and shorts with the dogs and imply something like 'have a doggie-style of a time'. its priceless, as is his performance.i hope that people engage in this 90-minute 'dogumentary'. the film deserves so much recognition. it did get nominated for best picture-comedy at the golden globes, but didn't win. i can't see why. i mean, in the comedy department, it is best in show.grade: a</review>",0,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-679d3cbe-1e1e-4543-b56f-b0f631fe723b', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712229, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Positive\nBased on the review, the film is described as being ""incredibly funny, smart, and a unique blend of comedy, humor, and clever storytelling.""

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. the highlight of the movie is a comparison between the smell of natural gas and a dirty vagina. the acting is pathetic. i know acting is hard work and stuff, but that's why it should be left to real actors. watching these people act is like watching michael j. fox perform brain surgery. it's shaky at best. one of the other comments would have you believe that the movie is saved by the acting talents of dan gordon as chris. only dan himself or maybe his mother could believe that was good acting. the special effects in this movie were terrible. the worst special effects were for the gas explosion in the lighthouse. it looked like someone was shining an orange light up from the bottom of a model constructed from a refrigerator box. sure there was a little bit of computer animation layered over top, but it didn't help. i suspect that the special effects on this movie were created and rendered using a single amiga computer from the late 80s.</review>",1,1,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-76de0b95-1865-4521-9b49-6dc2f3ccc725', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712233, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Based on the content of the review, the sentiment is clearly Negative.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>to some of us, director ernst lubitsch, adored for his underlying cheekiness and ironic comic touches, was rather wet when it came to picking material. it isn't that lubitsch is overrated--on the contrary, he probably was ahead of his time in terms of a visual narrative--yet the projects he became attached to (or was assigned to) are not quite the landmarks of comedy his fans like to label them. with 'heaven can wait', a screen-adaptation of lazlo bus-fekete's play 'birthday', lubitsch is saddled with sleepy don ameche in the lead--and the combination of an anemic plot, a colorless star, and a musty flashback-framework stymies the director. a wicked man at the turn of the century 'falls asleep without realizing it', presenting the facts of his life in front of hell's entrance. ameche...wicked? that was problem number one. the promising opening sequence (set in the hades lobby) quickly gives way to dreary whimsy, and the supporting cast is of little help. *1/2 from ****</review>",1,1,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-f377c059-6fd9-41c6-8168-7d64acbe40ee', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712244, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""This review is Negative.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>'i am ... proud of 'head',' mike nesmith has said. he should be, because this film, which either has been derided by many of us or studied and scrutinized by film professors, works on many levels.yes, it's unconventional. to many, frustrating. it's almost as if the producers hand you the film and tempt: 'you figure it out.'you probably already know that the monkees tv show was a runaway marketing success that depended upon business acumen and no small serving of public deception. tv shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first, than to entertain. that the monkees broke out of the box for a short time to make 'head' is a testament to the group's popularity and importance in pop culture, despite where your head's at. get one thing straight: 'head' is not the monkees tv show.so what we have here is a 'psychedelic documentary' about western pop culture from a source that has authority on the subject. 'head' is a movie that could only come from those 'inside the box'. by 1968, the monkees' cast and crew were seasoned and weary professionals who had seen their share of promise and disappointment. the movie was a deliberate attempt at market repositioning. so, it did three things: make a film the way the monkees envisioned. most importantly, reinvent the group to one not subservient to it's old bosses - and yas, hipper than before. make a film that exposed american attitudes of information dissemination.'head', therefore, really is about media manipulation and its net result: deception. the mass media is supposed to inform, educate us on the happenings in the world at large, and ultimately asks us to form opinions of these events that can shape thought into positive action. thus we assume the information we absorb to be complete and unbiased - otherwise, how can one establish a valued conclusion on any one idea presented by a book, newspaper or tv show? in one of the street interviews in 'head', a guy admits, 'i haven't looked at a newspaper or tv in years.' is he lesser or better the man? even the drug parallels are a soft veiling of 'things are not as they seem.' remember the old joke, 'everything you know is wrong'? the screenplay starts with the monkees' public admission of it's own 'manufactured image' and runs with the football - literally. is the football scene in the movie a visual manifestation of the whole idea behind 'head'? is the film a stream-of-consciousness exercise? is the film the culmination of pot smoking marathons? there are too many coincidences that occur in the film that suggest otherwise. my guess is that 'head' is the culmination of motivations somewhere between intended and unintended.largely, the insiders responsible for 'head' seem to enjoy themselves in the revelries that take place in the film, but there is anger - anger at the chaos that characterized the late '60s and anger at the way the media, television especially, had changed culture in negative ways. drugs and violence were strong negative forces in the late '60s and still are, but the producers of 'head' want you to know that poor 'information' is a far greater danger.wars have been attributed to hoaxes and lies. what perfect way to spread disinformation than through tv? repeatedly, the mysterious black box is seen as an obstacle to the monkees and seemingly, all of us as well. in one scene, peter is sullenly sitting in a saloon holding a melting ice cream cone, and is asked by a fellow monkey, 'what's wrong?' 'i bought this ice cream cone and i don't want it.' the movie suggests that the first purpose of the media is not to inform, but to sell en mass blindly. 'head' goes further: put any idea into someone's head, and merrily goes he.the filmmakers know this, and the danger is real. 'head' is either a movie that creates itself 'as we go along', or is a deliberate statement. perhaps, perhaps not. maybe it is just 'pot meets advertising', as critics scathed in 1968. the jokes are on the monkees and us. be careful what you ask for, you may get it.cheers: a true guilty pleasure. very funny. intelligent. will please the fans. find the substance, it's there. unabashedly weird. bizarre collection of characters. good tunage. length is appropriate. lots of great one liners, including my all time prophetic favorite: 'the tragedy of your times, my young friends, is that you may get exactly what you want.'caveats: dated. drugs. no plot. no linear delivery of any thought in particular. at least twenty-five stories that interweave in stop-and- go fashion. so, may easily frustrate. may seem pretentious to some. people who can't stand the monkees need not watch, though that in itself is no reason to avoid it. the psychedelic special effects may kill your ailing picture tube or your acid burnt- out eyeballs.match, cut.</review>",1,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-20323d38-205f-44e3-972c-4e6d81f3b30e', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712253, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Based on the content of the review, the sentiment is negative.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>the first time i ever saw this movie was when i was four years old. i remember loving it and everything about it. 13 years later, i am now 17, and decided to watch it about a month ago because i am taking a 1960's class in school. i didn't really know what to expect, since it had been 13 years since i last saw it, but i was completely blown away by it. the actors were amazing, the music was so fun, and i now find myself singing along to every song. treat williams is great as berger, the 'leader' of the hippie group, who always gets what he wants, one way or another (except for at the very end, of course). john savage is actually very convincing as claude, the oklahoma draftee who falls in love with sheila (beverly d'angelo). d'angelo is lovely as the prim and proper rich girl who eventually rebels against her upbringing and joins the hippies. the other hippies are played by annie golden, don dacus, and dorsey wright. annie golden is just adorable as jeannie, the girl who is pregnant but still as cute and innocent as a child. don dacus and dorsey wright are good as woof and hud, the other two members of the group, and cheryl barnes, who plays hud's fianc√©e, has an amazing voice. the only problem i have with this movie, however, is that the relationship between claude and sheila is not very convincing. they are barely ever shown together, and when they are, they fight (remember the skinny dipping scene?). it seems as though their relationship is very weak, and by the end of the movie we are supposed to believe they are madly in love, only based on the few meetings they had. i also see that many people writing reviews here are upset by the pg rating this movie has. i personally would raise the rating up to a pg-13, only because there is some drug use... but remember in 1979, pg-13 didn't exist. i don't think the nudity is bad at all, it is in no way sexual (in fact, there isn't really any sex at all in this movie), and it is only to show the childlike innocence that the group maintains. in most european countries, nudity isn't regarded as something bad, and i don't see why it is here in the us. anyways, i give this movie a high rating, and i'm glad it was made back then, because in the insanely 'politically correct' world of today, they wouldn't even think of making it, and even if they did, it would be a very 'watered down' version, and i'm sure you wouldn't get the full effect. in conclusion, this is a very underrated film that is definitely worth checking out.</review>",0,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-99a8f431-4403-4bce-9da0-4457e7f30615', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712255, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Based on my analysis of the review, I would give the movie a low rating.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>this film is a great disappointment. director vicente aranda has provided many interesting films throughout his long career, some of them were highlighted by strong and powerful performances by spanish actress victoria abril. in juana la loca, he relies on a gifted actress as well , newcomer pilar lopez de ayala, but this is barely the sole positive element in an otherwise terrible mess of a movie. while lopez de ayala tries hard to portray juana as a romantic and passionate young woman, completely obsessed by love to her handsome husband, it seems as if she weren't able to develop her character over this one-dimensional feature; juana was an important figure in spanish history, and politics of that time were essential in her storyline... but here she's introduced as a romantic leading lady out of a soap opera; this is a real pity, and the film a missing opportunity to show the way personal lives can influence history and vice versa. worst of all, italian actors daniele liotti and manuela arcuri turn out in real bad performances, which, in the case of liotti is a real problem as he portrays felipe el hermoso, a pivotal role in this story. it seems a clear choice to attract young audiences, as both of them look like top-models of this era. on the other hand, talented actors such as giuliano gemma and rosana pastor are completely wasted in supporting roles clearly underdeveloped. even if this was a big-budgeted film, little care was taken in bringing a good screenplay or creating 'period pieces' on the screen. costumes are particularly grotesque in some of the group scenes, as if they were taken from stock material,without regarding of a real coherence. all in all, the main problem with juana la loca (and this is what makes the difference with far superior historical films as la reine margot or elizabeth) is the lack of a director's point of view. this a strange turn in aranda's career, as he was able to develop it in other works (libertarias and amantes come to my mind), creating very personal and interesting movies, while this juana really is no more than a routine academic historical piece... and a not very good one at that!</review>",-1,1,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-564531a9-39e4-4b42-84b4-4087e89202ff', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712256, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Based on the content of the review, the main issue with <review>...</review> is the lack of directorial perspective.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>as said before, the visual effects are stunning. they're breathtaking. i personally use blender and graphics like that are not easy at all. but that's all this movie is. not only is the plot confusing, but the overall conflict is not clear. for example, in the first scene, proog and emo are trying to run away from who knows what. the conflict seems to be between man and nature here. later, when they enter the room of the bottomless pit, proog explains that 'one step out of place and (you're dead)'. here, there's a more precise conflict between the careless man and nature. as the movie progresses, it's clear that a conflict exists between man and nature. but suddenly, a conflict exists between man and man when proog, out of nowhere, murders emo. proog immediately changes from being a caring guardian looking after a lost child to being a 'sick man'. he betrays us. not only is this depressing, but we don't care because the conflict between the character's thoughts and actions is not developed. it's not a story about someone, through struggle, emerging stronger. it's depressing and has not point because there's no great truth about the human soul or about the world brought to light like a great drama does. in my opinion, the movie is severely underdeveloped in all aspects. however, the graphics are stunning, but a movie is so much more than mere eye candy. there's no truth, no struggle and a bad surprise ending. in conclusion, an underdeveloped movie without a point. ...but the graphics are good.</review>",1,1,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-4fb2aafd-102b-4ebd-a70f-96149370c1b8', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712259, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Based on the given review, the movie is not underdeveloped and instead, the movie is confusing and underdeveloped.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>i have been a huge fan of the original crew of the enterprise since i was eight years old. i watched all the movies and appreciated each one for what they retained from the old series and for further developing the characters (and the star trek universe, in general). even in 'the undiscovered country' i thought the aging of the characters was well handled and the story worthy of a theatrical release. however, having said that, 'star trek v: the final frontier' is easily the worst of the series featuring the original crew. i agree with many that the camaraderie of kirk, spock and mccoy is well handled, but the overall script, the direction -- by william shatner -- and the special effects are not worthy of anything more than a television episode. this is a 'buddy movie' and, at times, almost unrecognizable as a star trek movie. the action sequences are not sustained and therefore, build little or no tension. the dialogue is weak though it does provide for a few laughs, both intended and not-intended. the klingon's seem thrown in as an afterthought. the whole 'sha-ka-ree' concept is just silly and laurence luckinbill, a fine actor in everything else i've ever seen him in, boarders on the absurd in this movie. the scene where sybok conjures up images of spock's pain and mccoy's pain shatters the image of the characters as we've known them. spock would never be party to such stupidity and mccoy, trying to save his father is full of insipid, redundant dialogue and totally wastes deforest kelley's acting abilities. the whole scene is wasted and really shows us nothing new and nothing we want to see from these characters. i understand that shatner didn't have the luxury of working with ilm for the special effects and that the budget for this movie was tight, but that doesn't allow for such a bad story. in some respects, i think this story does fit in with the old series, but the movies, including 'star trek: the motion picture' are all much better quality than this. it's a shame that most of the other characters have so few lines and so little to do with most of this movie. the focus on kirk, mccoy and spock is nice, but way over used. the old crew really seems to be out of character. i liked the old klingon general and the sultry romulan in the bar. i liked some of the humor and the idea that spock has a half-brother, but that's about it. if this was a tv episode, i'd be able to accept a lot of the faults. as a movie, this is just bad, uninspired film making. it's a shame too, because i want this movie to be good. even if it was the level of 'star trek iii' i would be happy, but this movie makes all the other movies in this series seem like works of shakespeare.</review>",-1,1,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-38cab9a8-0949-4625-aaae-a693d34ce19e', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712304, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Based on my analysis of the review, I would rate the film 'star trek v: the final frontier' (STV) as being the worst of the original series.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>who won the best actress oscar for 1933? it should have been laura hope crewes for her magnificent portrayal of the most monstrous mother ever. she truly is one of the great character actresses of all time. she played the frivolous prudence duvernoy in 'camille' (1936) and her best remembered role is aunt pittypat in 'gone with the wind'.irene dunne was the 'official' star of the film but her scenes with laura hope crewes were dynamite.david (joel mccrea) is in heidelberg when he is offered a job in new york. his wife, christine (irene dunne) can continue her studies at the rockafellar centre. their first stop in america is a visit to david's mother, mrs. phelps. to say that laura hope crewes dominates every scene is an under-statement. from her first entrance - in a frantic burst of effort to greet her 'big boy' - all attention is on her. even sitting around the tea table, when she forgets hester's existence, even forgetting how she takes her tea, you know something is not quite right.(hester has been living there for a while.)frances dee is completely sweet and so right in her role as the adorable hester. her performance in this film, especially the scene where she has hysterics and the aftermath proves how under-rated as an actress she was.all the young cast are excellent. eric linden is superb as robert, the younger son who comes to the realization that his mother is horrible but can do nothing about escaping from his mother's spell. joel mccrea, at one point says 'painting roses on bathtubs - that's more your style'. there is a very subtle suggestion in the film of robert's sexuality.irene dunne is excellent in whatever film or genre she tried.</review>",0,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-0cd66370-273a-4d0f-b8c4-274ed29cdffd', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712307, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'This review is highly positive.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>i didn't realize just how much of this episode was taken from the enemy below until i finally saw the movie (it has since become my fave war flick). there were a couple of elements lifted from run silent run deep as well. nothing wrong with stealing ideas, as long as you do something cool with them. and boy did roddenberry and company do something cool with this one.the story begins when the romulans violate a 100-year old treaty and by crossing the neutral zone and destroying a series of federation outposts along the zone, ostensibly to test their superior weaponry and invisibility screen (and subsequent shift in the balance of power between the romulans and the federation, in their view) as a prelude to an all-out invasion. kirk has to decide whether it's worth risking war to try and stop the romulan ship, or if in fact the greater risk lies in letting the invaders go after they destroyed 4 military outposts. kirk wisely chooses the latter.this is our first look at an enemy of the federation, the romulans, a warlike, yet in their own way honorable race who are distant relatives to the vulcans. however, unlike their peaceful cousins, the romulans did not renounce their emotions and violent and imperialistic ways, even as they advanced technologically.none of this matters to mr. stiles, the ship's navigator and this episode's chief antagonist on board the enterprise (the romulan commander has his own problems with a gung-ho junior officer). all that matters to him is he hates romulans and spock looks like one..until the end when spock saves his life (naturally). this contrasts sharply with captain kirk and the romulan commander, neither of whom has any personal ill will towards the other at all. both men are simply doing their duty. in fact there's a mutual respect. this is the first trek episode to deal directly with prejudice, and it does so deftly (as opposed to season 3's not-so-subtle 'let that be your last battlefield').like the enemy below, we have a classic chess match between two ship commanders who are actually very much alike. you see right away that both of these captains are good..very good. if you were going into battle you'd want either of these man as your leader. both are honorable and decent men who are duty bound. yet even though the romulan commander is bound by duty to his home world, he still finds himself wishing for destruction before he can make it home rather than start another interstellar war. yet he still does everything he can to make it home, just as kirk does everything he can to stop him.this is, in my opinion, one of trek's 5 best. it has everything: plenty of action, suspense, great dialogue, fine acting (i still maintain the romulan commander was mark lenard's best trek role), and it manages to make its social commentary without being overly preachy. a pity roddenberry forgot about the last part when he did tng.watch this episode, then watch the enemy below.</review>",0,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-e9c115e9-2bf1-43fb-ba88-fdeab0875309', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712314, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Based on the content of the review, the overall sentiment of this movie can be summarized as positive.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>yeah, what did i expect? i thought this would be a film about young adults at their turning-point in life, something like 'sonnenallee' or 'american pie', which i liked a lot. i wanted to see a funny film, perhaps with an ironic look on idyllic wuerzburg. and what did i get?attention, spoilers ahead!this film starts with a lengthy dialogue which gives you a good hint of what will inevitably follow: more lengthy dialogues. sometimes i thought moritz bleibtreu might have forgotten his text and trying to hide that fact by improvising and just repeating what he was saying before. but as i think of bleibtreu as one of the better german actors, i believe that this effect really was intended. i think the author wanted to show how boring talking to close friends can be - especially when they are stoned. but really, i don't need cinema to be bored by stoned friends' talk. boring dialogues make up most of this film.but okay, that's one thing. i can cope with that, i have seen nice films with abominable dialogues, just think of schwarzenegger's life's work. but the next thing is that characters are cheap and flat and that the storyline is as foreseeable as anything. just one example (spoiler!!): why, do you think, does someone take a garden hose to his hemp-plants deep in the forest? to water them? of course not, usually you don't find water-pipes deep in forests, do you? the only reason this water-hose is there is that a hunter who happens to come by while the two protagonists are harvesting their dope can be drugged, maltreated and finally filled up with three bottles of jaegermeister. i truly hated this scene, because it's really violent. usually, i don't mind violence in films - slapstick-comedies are full of it. but in that sort of comedy there is a silent agreement between the film and you that people don't get hurt if they fall on their faces or get beaten with chairs or things like that. but if that happens in a film which is otherwise realistic enough, slapstick-scenes also seem real. in this particular scene in 'lammbock' i really thought that this hunter must be badly injured, if not dead - the final scene really invoked in me the impression that he is left to die there, totally filled up with more booze anyone could handle. and the protagonists just walk away. it would have been otherwise if the author had consistently followed one style; the scene could have been quite funny.talking about being consistently - that's what i missed most about this film. the whole film seems to be a listing of small episodes that came to the author's mind. things just happen without a apparent reason - yeah, i know, that's life, but that's not cinema, because cinema is meant to tell a story, not to show boring episodes without any significance. i found myself asking 'where's the point?' all the time. characters besides the two main ones are not elaborated, you never get to know why the protagonist's sister wants to sleep with his best friend kai, in fact, she tells you but i could not buy it, not at all. i think she just was there to give kai an opportunity to act this childish aids-test sketch, which you sure have seen a thousand times before, and mostly better. the protagonist's girlfriend you meet once, then she leaves germany (what you don't even see and the guy doesn't seem to care) and finally it is mentioned in one sentence that she has met someone else in america and splits up with the protagonist. it seemed to me that the author wanted to tie up a few loose ends. he actually didn't, you never really get to know what's so bad about studying law, being daddy's son (daddy fixes everything in the end and serves coffee in the middle of the night, which to my mind made him one of the nicer characters in the whole film) and living in beautiful wuerzburg. even the dinner with daddy's layer-friend, which maybe was intended to show how horrible it is to have to live up to dad's expectations, seemed flat, just another nice dinner with the family's friends (except for the trip the guy is on later, but i think showing that eating dope before you dine with parents isn't healthy was not the point of this scene, if there was any). i have experienced far worse dinners in my life than this one and still finished my exams. i couldn't understand one single character in the whole film, they just seemed flat and implausible.all this made it a not-so-good film, but not one i wouldn't watch again on television. it really had a few good scenes (most of them were not new, though, like the one with the nice and understanding policemen), some were really funny, some dialogues were nice and i like bleibtreu's play, although he repeated his well-known stereotypes again this time. not good, not abominable, that's what i thought after the film was half over.but then came this incest scene and this i really found repulsive. incest simply isn't funny. i don't even know if this was intended to be funny, some people in the audience laughed, so it could have been meant this way. this scene spoiled the whole film for me, i couldn't feel sympathy for the protagonist any more - i can't feel sympathy for anyone who f**** a helpless person, to me, this is rape and rape isn't funny. so it might have been a hint of drama or so, but the incest is never again mentioned (although we thought this could have been one reason for the protagonist to leave germany in the end, but as it is never mentioned again, we don't know.), it is even totally unnecessary. i almost expected the sister to become pregnant in the end, which would just have added the finishing touch to this tasteless story, but not even this final cliche is fulfilled, just as nothing is really solved or thought through to the end in this film. it isn't really funny, it isn't really a drama, it isn't at all a road movie a la tarantino despite desperate tries on violence, it is definitely not enjoyable.skip this film. watch 'final fantasy', that's also bad, but at least with beautiful pictures and not that tasteless.</review>",1,1,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-ed905ff2-7263-4a7d-82ce-adbfb5804e7a', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712316, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'This review seems to be a negative critique of the film ""Lammbock"".

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>before 'zavet' there was similarity between tim burton and kusturica artistic vision. they find their own, poetic style, and then they cowardly become prisoners of it. burton has (and still have) depp, kusturica has miki manojlovic, and somehow they got critical praise for repeating same formula over and over again. however, there are persons like me who find joke funny only when they heard it first time. that's main reason why kusturica's worst movies are 'black cat white cat' and 'life is miracle'. 'zavet' is something completely different. you may like it, you may hate it, but this is not just another kusturica poetic ¬ñ balkanic dreamlike stuff. of course, if you want to be praised, you have to play safe. it was very easy for kusturica to make just another flying gypsies movie and get award. fortunately, as a brave person he chooses to make movie that will be ironic look to his previous works. 'zavet' can be described as a strong and very harsh parody on previous kusturica movies directed by kusturica himself. it is beautiful to see one big movie director to not take himself too seriously. this is quality that kusturica have and even the biggest, like bergman or kubrick, didn't have. this movie is so meaningless that becomes absurd, so absurd that becomes deep, and so unfunny that becomes hilarious. same stuff that make 'plan 9 from outer space' cult would made this masterpiece to people who knows how to watch it. average western viewer would not get few references. most notable, tire shop owner is srbljanovic , and this refers to biljana srbljanovic, famous serbian dramatic writer. politically, she is very active as left oriented liberal, and she despises kusturica's political views and anarchism. kusturica's 'everything but not subtle' take to her work was to castrate miki manojlovic in srbljanovic shop. second reference is made to goran bregovic ¬ñ previous kusturica's composer. he formed 'funeral and wedding orchestra' and start performing around europe. although he is praised as big composer, bregovic is just performer and most of his songs (if not all) are poor covers of traditional serbian songs. kusturica's take on bregovic was to confront one wedding and one funeral, with funeral mocking the wedding. also, music is covering western classics as 'london bridge is falling down' or french lullabies. you find this unfunny? now you see how we feel in serbia when listening bregovic's horrible covers. i really liked this movie because it is not pretending to be deep, it is so overfilled with symbols that it becomes parody, and it is beautifully directed, as all of his works are. if you like previous kusturica's movies, there is a big chance that you will hate this. if you don't like couple of his last movies, you may find this as pleasant surprise, because this is like fellini directing 'pink flamingos'. on purpose. i have massive respect for this guy after 'zavet'. next tim burton movie would surely have main character with pale faces. next kusturica movies can easily be about aliens invading earth. that's the reason why he is most interesting director on earth, whether you like it or not.</review>",0,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-dbec7d95-0698-4025-9f28-d0e46c6e4962', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712318, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Based on the sentiment analysis, the movie ""Zavet"" is predominantly positive, with the reviewer praising the overall style and themes of the film.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>the chinese film title of 'in the mood for love' is 'fa yeung nien wah.' it can be interpreted as 'those blossoming years (that once were).'the whole film is a well-composed piece. a complex love story told in simple visual approach. writer-director wong kar-wai has choreographed a dancing of the hearts - it's she, it's he, it's love. i can hear galasso's theme: dum dum-dum, dum dum-dum, and the strings - almost like heartbeats. a piece with prelude, stanzas, and epilogue.director optimized the use of music (michael galasso's score, nat king cole singing in spanish, and chinese songs/tunes). the rhythm and lyrics prompt viewers to what she and he is feeling/thinking rather than verbal dialogs. i can hear nat king cole giving us the clues: 'aquello¬Öojos verde' (that thing, fling, eyes green) plays when the two meet, and 'quizas, quizas, quizas' (perhaps¬Ö) when she's undecided.nostalgia pervades throughout the film. design details plentiful: handbags and ties; japanese rice-cooker novelty; the ridged pattern green glass cups & saucers and plates (i remember dad treasured those at home); mahjong session; kitchen area; bedroom furnishings; the thermos for the take-out noodles that she swings when she walks. maggie cheung, slender and shapely, looks exquisite in those fashionable patterns & colors of the traditional chinese woman clothing - 'cheung sam'. every change of her dress denotes another day, another time in the story. wong kar-wai is resourceful that way.the scenes may be of the same place, but it's of a different mood, advanced to the next stanza. up and down the stairs to the won-ton noodle stand. standing by the wall around the corner to the apartments as the rain pours. along the corridor, back and forth, to his writing corner.trivia: so she helps him with his writing of his martial arts novel. maggie would be able to help as she's been in kung fu/martial arts movies. 'eastern three heroes' 1992 is a fun action movie with maggie cheung (thief catcher chat), michelle yeoh and anita mui as three super heroes fighting evils.if you appreciate tony leung's performance, don't miss 'chungking express' 1994 (in the second segment - romance rhythm with a difference), and 'happy together' 1997 (an intense, emotionally colorful painting of friendships, faith, and fate), both written and directed by wong kar-wai.being able to understand the cantonese and shanghainese dialects, and having visited the official site, i realized the epilogue was not quite completely translated. here's sharing my version of the chinese captions:it was kind of an unbearable encounter all along she has kept her head lowered giving him a chance to get closer he didn't have the courage to be closer she turned around, walked away.that time and place had come to past. all that belonged, no longer exist. _______those vanished years, seemingly separated by a glass gathering dust, can see, yet cannot grasp.all along he has longed for all that's past if he can break through that dust-gathered glass he will walk back into the times long vanished. ________wong kar-wai's 'in the mood for love' brings to mind the simple poetry and wisdom of rumi, the sufi philosopher - the 'inner and outer,' the 'spirit and body' of life, love and living.[resend. revised. ruby_fff 2/22/01]</review>",0,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-6e9713fe-762c-41d6-8c59-f5ee99022062', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712319, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""This review is mostly positive, with some minor criticism.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>after all these years i still consider this series the finest example of world war ii documentary film making. the interviews with the many participants from all countries set this apart from any other project. it would be great to see a contemporary documentarian(ken burns ?) take on this topic and try to gather information from veterans before they are all gone. with modern technology to improve old archival footage and lots of information that has been unearthed since 1974 when the world at war was produced, an updated version of this series would be welcome. the history channel has made some fine shows dealing with many aspects of wwii but an expansive series such as the world at war has not been successfully attempted since the original. if you are interested in this era don't miss this series. it is required viewing.</review>",0,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-1ea5a15b-024d-40b6-ad80-efa241401f36', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712329, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Positive'}, 'logprobs': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop'}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 241, 'completion_tokens': 1, 'total_tokens': 242}}"

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>'descent.' yeah. boy... i haven't seen anything this powerful and scintillating since bruno dumont's, 'twentynine palms' (2003). (by the way this film is not to be confused with another fairly recent pic about the topic of 'female empowerment,' 'the descent' (2005), directed by our splat pack friend, neil marshall, who also happens to be a major talent his own right.) but getting back to this 'descent,' the nc-17 rated (uh-oh) effort on which the lovely ms. dawson takes a producer's credit (congratulations) and directed by talia lugacy (strong chance that's not a real name), as good as it is (in moments), it will not be appreciated by most lay people out there because the script is pretty flawed. as a producer, you really have to tighten up that script. of course, in the premise alone, you have the promise of rising conflict, but there still lies the task therein of accomplishing rising conflict.at times, this thing plays like an interesting piece of experimental theater and, well, i guess i'll let the others who've already commented here speak to the boringness of it, namely that which occurs in the second act -but find me a second act that isn't boring? there's also this catch 22 that goes along with these quasi-independent films like 'descent' in which rosario happens to be attaching herself to and leveraging her 'fame-identity' to get a script into production that would, under usual circumstances, not get made at all while at the same time she is basically a miscast in the film's leading role. rosario dawson is gorgeous and, apparently, you can shoot this girl from just about any angle all day long, but, oh, wow-wee, how fast the time just slips away: rosy ain't no undergraduate no more. that's part of the confusion about the screenplay: 'is she a graduate student? a ta? no, graduate students don't really have these type of qualms with football players, do they?' again, if you are rosario dawson, executive producer, that's the one of many, many aspects to the professional film process you'll have to think about as you embark on this wonderful new role in your film career. and if you don't have the answer to why you're movie isn't convincing, let me tell you: there is a boatload and a bevy of vivacious, well-qualified, undergraduate aged talents, pining to get involved in the business, who might have nailed that lead character down, all the while, looking just as darn good as you know who; but unfortunately without ms. dawson -no honey, no money. i have to say, the camera department did an outstanding job, however, because this film is really well shot (i.e. lit) in all its dreary/dreamy darkness. the nightclub scenes look wonderful; one can tell all those music videos are starting to pay off and the play with time... the shooting/framing is all quite excellent which makes the picture a rewarding watch.'descent' is good not great. however, i have a feeling, thanks to netflix, this movie will find a life of its own. i hope this group continues making films. if you're into experimental american film-making, cinematographic imagery of implausibly well formed college studs (or male model drop-outs) in their early twenties, or if you're an undergraduate, just plain angry at the hormonally aggressive young men that comprise less than half of your american university, 'rosario dawson's descent' might be your flavor of rockaroll.</review>",0,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-2dae2141-1348-4e4a-a371-320dd7d89de0', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712333, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'This movie is not to be confused with another recent film directed by our Splat Pack friend, who is also known as a major talent from his own right.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>'slaughter high' is, perhaps, the most underrated slasher flick of the 1980s. it is one of the few films in the genre that is enthralling throughout. that being said, it also relies heavily on the standard slasher formula: a group of young men and women get killed one by one gruesomely until the final showdown.the reason why 'slaughter high' stands above most movies in its genre is that it goes more over-the-top. marty, the killer, has good reason to hold a grudge against his former classmates. they electrocuted him as he stood naked in a girl's locker room shower, jabbed at his crotch with a javelin, and, to top it off, rigged his science lab experiment so it could disfigure him.so, the victims in this movie are about as unlikeable as you get. when they reunite years later -- at a high school reunion put on by marty himself -- you realize they haven't matured all that much. they're a bunch of sociopaths.it is mind-boggling why they would not wonder why they were the only ones to show up to the reunion, which, by the way, is held at a school that has since fell into disrepair. and who would think it's a good idea to drink beer and liquor found in the abandoned building in a room that happens to have their old lockers -- as well as marty's -- on display? there are many leaps of faith the viewer needs to take to enjoy this film. the ending makes little or no sense. and the screenwriters have a strange understanding of how april fool's day works: the movie claims that pranks are no longer allowed after noon.in all, the movie is one of the best examples of the slasher genre, despite all of its flaws. it is hard to understand why it hasn't yet found its way to dvd, when so many other run-of-the-mill slasher flicks are graced with special editions.</review>",-1,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-e80fdc4d-6306-4c49-a31c-3938cff030cd', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712361, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Based on the given review, the movie 'slaughter high' is likely one of the most underrated slasher flicks of the 1980s.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>the film is not visually stunning in the conventional sense. it doesn't present a series of pretty pictures. instead it is a visually interesting film. it forces the viewer to constantly process or perhaps imagine the context of the various shots. this sort of thing is easy to try but hard to succeed at. the film refuses to use the crutch of a genre to help the less than fully engaged viewer get what's going on. instead the film touches on and moves through a number of different genres. the trick to loving the film is being able to enjoy this playfulness. i suspect 99% of north american viewers will just not get it. if you try to pin down the narrative of this film, or the philosophical message, or the symbolist structure, etc. you will waste your time. there are none of these. the film only feints towards these genres and others at times. the only unifying force in the film is claire denis's own sense of what fits together. there are so few feature length films that come close to satisfying kant's description of what art is, namely the enjoyment of the power of judgment itself instead of simply subsuming experiences under concepts. film usually takes the easy way out and opts for the simpler pleasure of understanding what's happening. most film is not art. most film doesn't come close to art. when a film does, as this one does, and is still enjoyable by a large range of viewers, it's something of a miracle. my on negative comment is that at times i find the film too simplistically buying in to the various narrative threads that run through it. the tahiti father-son narrative, even though it's not exactly conventional, ends up making things a little to clear and simple. it dominates too much.</review>",0,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-6218bc65-a001-4de2-b4b1-d70da603e346', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712363, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Based on the content of the review, the sentiment is positive, as it discusses the film's visual appeal, attempts to engage the viewer's imagination, and its unique features, such as Claire Denis's sense of fitting together different genres and themes.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>i've watched many short films in my day. often i find them either too compressed (throwing too much information at the viewer in the short amount of time they have to run), too 'artsy', or lacking a clear-cut vision. i can say none of these things about starcrossed. in this review, i'll do my best to avoid any dramatic spoilers, but i'll also assume that the reader understands that the theme of this film is brotherly incest.as with any short film, the story is fairly simple, straightforward and easy to digest. it's clear that the film attempts to shine a light one one of modern society's most deeply held taboos. this film succeeds in every respect. in the fifteen minutes of running time, i found myself feeling a gamut of emotions. with only a little dialog, the viewer is rapidly pulled into the most personal moments and thoughts of these star-crossed brothers.from the opening scene set in their early childhood, one can see the very close relationship the brothers have. when the film progresses to the present day in the next scene, the excellent acting and honest, heartfelt performances remind the viewer that love can come in the most unexpected and harsh way. as the relationship progresses, any disgust the viewer may initially feel is quickly replaced by sympathy and emotional distress as the viewer suddenly realizes that there can be only one possible resolution. and the aftermath of that resolution is heart-rending.anyone with an open mind would do well to watch this film and absorb its message. if nothing else, it boldly and honestly challenges the viewer to reexamine some of our deepest beliefs on the shame-filled and secretive taboo of incest. though the film is only fifteen minutes long, it resonates in the viewer long after the credits roll. this is perhaps my favorite short film i've ever seen. i can't recommend it highly enough.</review>",0,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-e4dd1759-db98-40a9-b0f3-6d957d920c27', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712373, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""The review is mostly positive, but there are a couple of issues that indicate potential improvement.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>the version of this film i saw was titled 'horror rises from the tomb'. the horror in question is a wicked medieval magician played by spanish horror legend paul naschy looking like he's playing abanazer in a church hall panto. he rises from his tomb when a stupid descendant (i think he's a descendant, as he's also played by naschy)returns to his ancestral home and reunites the magician's head and body, which had been separated by by the witchfinders who executed him, in an attempt to stop him, er, rising from the tomb.obviously, once head and body are back together all hell breaks loose and lots of people die. like all good magicians, abanazer here has a lovely assistant. this one's played by another spanish horror great, the beautiful helga line. like practically every other woman in the film line periodically gets her kit off. there's a lot of nudity in this film, and not just female - we even get to see naschy's paunchy body, which isn't a pretty sight, i can tell you. most of the film's sex angle is laughably gratuitous. there's one particularly funny scene where naschy and line discuss their evil plans and then suddenly decide to both have a grope of the nubile young blonde they've possessed.it's also pretty gory in places - notably a herschell gordon lewis-esquire moment where line plunges her hands into a man's chest to remove his heart.the best part of the film is the pretty effective zombies who turn up towards the end. they're quickly scared off by a fire though, and don't bother coming back. which is a shame. the scene where the zombies rise, however, is the film's most ludicrously inept moment. it all happens in long shot, and we haven't really got a clue what's happening until we see some figures shambling on from the distance. there are several rubbish moments like this, thanks largely to poor editing. when a labourer falls under the hypnotic spell of naschy's head there's a big close up of his face that seems to last forever and serves no purpose whatsoever.all in all, not a great horror film, but entertaining enough. of course, the version i saw was a dubbed american version that had probably been chopped to pieces. for all i know, the original spanish version could be a masterpiece...</review>",1,1,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-225ccedb-ec41-4789-bf88-6d4c99d8f15e', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712377, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Based on the review, the film is not a good horror movie.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>the 12th animated disney classic is a reasonable movie told through a simple story. even though a little dated, it deserves a place in the list of disney classics.it's not among disney's top works, but is satisfying. one of disney's most 'simple' works, yes, but keeps a certain magic and enchantment (which old disney is well known for). this was an important movie because it saved disney from a delicate situation. if this was a failure, there wouldn't be any more disney animated classics.'cinderella' is somehow like a return to disney's 1st animated classic ('snow white and the seven dwarfs') because it brings back the fairy tale genre. it's not clear where the story takes place, but i suppose it's somewhere in france because this is based in a tale by charles perrault.there are plenty of likable characters, such as cinderella, the prince, bruno (the dog), jaques and gus (the two main mice), the fairy godmother (for a fairy she sure is funny), the birds, the king and the grand duke.jaques is very smart and amusing. i love his voice. really has that mouse-like quality. gus might not be that smart, but he's humorous.the king is hilarious, but i think that what makes him so funny is his short temper. the grand duke is a very cool chap and funny too. they're two of my favorite characters in this film and responsible for many of the most amusing moments.the prince is certainly one of the most charming in disney. no doubt that prince philip from 'sleeping beauty' was inspired on this prince, because they are very similar-looking.on the other hand, lady tremaine (the stepmother) isn't supposed to be likable because she's cold, jealous, bitter and cruel. her daughters (anastacia and drizella) aren't much better than her. however, the stepmother isn't as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters. cinderella, the main character, has nothing to do with them. cinderella is gentle, kind, pretty and lovable. by the way, i think her beautiful pink dress is much nicer than the one given by the fairy godmother.lucifer (the cat) is hilariously malicious. the way he walks, sticking up his nose in the air and those arrogant and snobbish facial expressions make him funny. ironically he's very much like the stepmother when it comes to personality. he always agrees with the stepmother's attitudes towards cinderella. lucifer has the right name for him because he's such a devilish and mean cat. yet, there's nothing annoying about him.the soundtrack is simple but pleasant, although not among disney's best. the best song in this movie is 'bibiddi bobiddi boo'.there are plenty of well known talented voice actors in this, such as james macdonald, marion darlington, eleanor audley, verna felton and luis van rooten.despite being simple-looking, the movie has good artwork, as well as its nice details, although never something 'out-of-this-world'. however, the king's palace is a spectacular masterpiece, being truly majestic and colossal.</review>",-1,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-2819bd87-0179-4fd7-a855-df2c06cc48ef', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712384, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Based on the given review, the movie is considered a good quality, not among Disney's top works, but a satisfying film that keeps magic and enchantment.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>it's not often i give two stars to a horror movie because horror is my favorite genre. a movie can be bad in that it isn't a masterpiece but can be enjoyable on the basis of unintentional humour, bizarre characters, etc. a case in point are a great number of horror/sci-fiction movies from the 1940s to 1980s era. they are enjoyable for genre-buffs and guilty-pleasure seekers because their 'badness' is entertaining. however, this movie has none of the humour or effective gory scenes of the 'piranha' (1978) original. i suppose in 1995 it was the heyday of political correctness so gore on tv was at a minimum. now in the mid-2000s with the c.s.i. shows, tv's an absolute blood-fest! (good for us horror fans!)william katt and alexandra paul are no bradford dillman and heather menzies (the original 1978 stars.) it's not katt's and paul's faults but the writers and director who created this tepid turkey. how the main characters interact is the main flaw of this movie. i won't say how because that is part of the plot. this tv movie probably had a bigger budget than the original but flopped as good horror, as can be seen from the user votes here. stick with the 1978 original if you're in the mood for a killer-fish movie!</review>",-1,1,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-afe357f7-caa9-420c-92e1-c51923d3a91f', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712386, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Based on the review, the movie is not a masterpiece, despite being entertaining, and lacks the expected horror elements from the 1990s era.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>/* slight spoilers */way back, before evangelion was made, before hideaki anno was an idol and household name for many anime fans, and before gainax had reached the status of fanfavorite, gunbuster was made. with only wings of honneamise made by gainax at that time, and the famous otakon shorts or course, gunbuster had some tough acts to follow up. it didn't make it easier on itself by picking out a genre that was already done countless times before, space opera.luckily, gainax decided to put it out as a six-part oav (direct to video) series. this allows the series to have a bigger scope than would have been possible if it was made into a film. this also prevents it from becoming too boring and overly long, with lots of pointless battles and filler along the way. besides that, they made some effort to stay clear from the tested space opera mechanics used in macross or gundam, and many other popular space operas.for one, the shows starts out pretty light, with noriko in the okinawa high school for mechapiloting. noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle, when she was still a little kid. this makes her life at the academy quite hard, as some of her fellow classmates start to suspect that noriko is favored by the professors. the first episode is pretty much a comedy drama, with a very tight focus on the characters and setting of the school. things quickly change when the threat of an alien invasion is announced, and noriko and kazumi (best girl in class) are chosen to help the assembled fleet out.the middle bulk of gunbuster leaves our female lead in space, focusing on both personal drama and action. a couple more characters are introduced, and parts of noriko's past are dragged up again. besides that, the alien threat becomes more imminent every minute, and the gunbuster, mankind's final hope, is presented. smart as writer okada was, he incorporated the principles of time dilation, to spice things up a bit. in short, time moves slower for those who travel at the speed of light. this means that noriko can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete. also the dramatic aspect of this is accentuated, when noriko sees her friends again on her return to base, who have aged considerably more than her. the science might not be perfect, but it's presented in a pretty believable way, with even some sd science theatre shorts in between the episodes, where noriko, kazumi and their coach give a short description of the scientific principles used in the series.the animation, for a series made in the 80s, is definitely good. the designs are retro 80s style of course, but it has it's charm. animation is fluent enough and the character designs are nice, although the costumes do betraysome of the fanservice fascination gainax will later exploit to the fullest. the mechas throughout the shows are pretty cool too, with the gunbuster as the ultimate killing machine, strong and vast. the last episode was entirely done in black and white. while it's generally believed (but not confirmed) that this was done for budget reasons, it lends a whole different atmosphere to the series, which is suited perfectly for the latter part.the music is very typical space opera fair. too bombastic in places, very generic, and definitely not worth buying. it does fit the series for the most part, but it can become quite annoying at times. tanaka is not really a famous composer, and the only other respectable series he's worked on is dragon half. if you think 80s anime music, you will know what to expect.as the series progresses, the focus slowly shifts from drama to space opera to epic battle, but in such a way the viewer will hardly notice this. step by step the drama will be toned down, and the battles will take the front row. neither aspect is ever left completely out though. with the last episode in sight, noriko and crew are fighting for the further existence of human kind, and with the last battle in sight, certain questions are presented to the audience, concerning to position of the human race in the galaxy, and how far it can go to guarantee self-preservation. while they are never answered later on, they still present some interesting food for thought. the last episode is very epic, with a nice, but quite predictable ending, though not all endings should contain numerous outlandish twists of course. again, it fits the series.gunbuster may sound like your average space opera anime at first, with alien invasions, huge battles, and some personal drama, and for the bigger part, it is. but it is done exceptionally well for a change. instead of going for a steady mix of former elements, six episodes long, gunbuster presents us a change from small scale drama to large scale epic heroism. along the way we meet with some various interesting and well fleshed-out characters, which mutual relationships changing heavily due to the time dilation phenomenon. the show is very tightly written, although it does tend to slip up at some points. overly dramatic occurrences and too cheesy mecha attacks could have been easily avoided. overall, the trip gunbuster takes you on is a very relaxed, sometimes sad, sometimes heroic one. it might not have shattered the boundaries and limits of the space opera genre, but at least it bend them a little. highly enjoyable anime classic, but not without flaws.***/*****</review>",0,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-57993f26-4410-44f5-b051-6d52597f6be6', 'object': 'chat.completion',

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>in 2054 paris, avalon, a computer generated system, controls the city and when a young woman is kidnapped, detective karas (craig) must go against avalon to find her.renaissance is a splendid blend of film making mixed with a conceptual futuristic narrative that lights up the screen in a shocking manor with a noir themed ideology and conceptual montages that should delight many.pixar are the animation masters. their numerous oscar winning films are endless from the charming toy story to the mystifying wall-e and so any company or director has a real challenge to knock them of their perch. renaissance isn't a film aimed for the young audience though, and like 2007's persepolis, brings a strong and mature approach to the genre of animation to make an older and more challenging film to its targeted older generation.in 2005 robert rodriguez released a shockingly brilliant noir sin city that shook up the whole usage of green screen with a splendid balance of filming in black and white with the odd spurts of colour and a year later, christian volckman took up a similar approach with this equally visually masterful stroke of film making.volckman's picture however is a full on animation but it doesn't half look realistic for the majority of it's strong 1 hour and 40 minutes of running time. the faces of the character's are well portrayed and in particular, this film has got to be the finest ever for the usage of shadow. the fact we never know if its night or day is irrelevant when simply gazing into the stony faces as the shadows blend across their expressions. it is almost a clever use of pathetic fallacy, and is finely directed also.for anyone who has seen persepolis you will have come to the conclusion it is one of the finest directed animations ever screened for the simple but highly conceptual artistic style by marjane satrapirenaissance is equally on terms with that picture and in many instances rivals it with stronger graphics and a darker tone to reflect the mood. one scene in particular when karas appears out of darkness is beautifully shot.the narrative revolves around a stubborn and nosey political government who keeps tabs on every citizen. the running of paris is down to the mysterious avalon which we don't see nearly enough to get an essence of its true dominance. renaissance is controlling the narrative around a tired cop's attempts to rescue the mysterious woman, and then we see craig's tired and boring cop attempt a rescue whilst battling with other elements. there are many things wrong with the scripting, not to mention the tired exasperated cop routine is now old, but there is plenty of dashing adrenaline and springy banter between characters to keep it alive right till a wonderfully shot shocking last couple of stages.</review>",-1,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-de21e535-c545-4e3a-b2d6-de501a9a4b03', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712395, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Based on the review, the movie appears to be a historical action film.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>i am fifteen years old and have seen thirty-three of sinatra's films (not counting videos of tv shows and documentaries) and have been unimpressed by only two of them. ''till the clouds roll by,' and 'the miracle of the bells' don't really count, however, considering that in the first all he does is sing a magnificent 'ol' man river,' and in the latter he's not half bad-only the picture is pathetic. my favorite records, radio shows, tv shows, and movies concerning sinatra change virtually every day-everything taking on a different connotation at each viewing and occasionally seeming the best thing he ever did and occasionally the worst until the cycle comes around again, but there are a couple things that are beyond comparison. when it comes to movies, 'the man with the golden arm' heads that list. everybody who knows anything about sinatra knows he thought this was his best-ever performance; he was oscar-nominated; it was the first serious look at drug addiction; etc.,etc. the jazz score is unforgettable, kim novak's likable despite a ludicrous accent, eleanor parker is annoying and waaaay too dramatic, the turtle-like arnold stang is amusing the first time but more embarrassing every time out, and darren mcgavin makes a wonderfully slimy drug dealer, the sets are unconvincing - at first glance it seems a peculiar mixed bag tossed together by the great otto preminger with an off-center charm. then you come to sinatra. like everything else in his life - other than music - reports of his acting are alway divided in half. directors like fred zinnemann, frank capra, billy wilder, stanley kramer, martin scorsese, peter bogdanovich, and otto preminger, all agreed that had sinatra worked as hard on his films as he did on singing, he'd have been among the greatest actors in the world - if not the greatest. humphrey bogart even said,'this guy has the most natural acting talent i've ever seen.' not bad for a man who never took an acting lesson in his life, was at the same time producing the discography that would make him 'the greatest singer of the 20th century,' and did almost all his scenes in one take. in direct conflict with all of this are those other reviews and biographies that sniff haughtily about what a lousy actor was this mr.sinatra, and how many 'bad' movies he made. the question will never be answered to everyone's satisfaction because controversy was among sinatra's greatest assets, and both arguments were in a sense playing into his hand. in any case, at this time, in this role, sinatra is magnificent. a reviewer said in the late fifties,'sinatra may not be the greatest actor in the world, but there is none more fascinating to watch.' no matter what sinatra is doing in a film, it's hard to take your eyes off him. this, of course, is a 'charisma,' that i've only seen in a handful of other people-orson welles, richard burton, marlon brando, montgomery clift-perhaps james cagney. there's no real definition for it and it often makes it hard to figure out whether you're really enjoying a performance or just spellbound, but that quality on display here is what makes the movie. sinatra is downright riveting, real, intense - transcending decades and thousands of paper-doll pop stars with something called quality. like it or not, this is a one-man show with a few character actors hanging around in the background. he covers every emotion with remarkable subtlety, from sweet, lonely tenderness with kim novak to the terrifying shock of frank sinatra (frank sinatra!) whimpering and screaming in the agony of 'cold turkey.' sinatra was right - this is his best performance. no question. i was eight when frank sinatra died. i wasn't around for all the years of bobby-soxers and ''anchors aweigh,'' mr. ava gardner and ''from here to eternity,' albums with lamp posts and ''swingin' lovers,' kennedy, vegas, ring-a- ding ding. basie and mia and reagan and concerts from madison square garden to south africa to the white house to the sands. i can't say i like sinatra because i heard him at the paramount or because i hear 'september of my years' autobiographically-the usual excuses. and my excuse? when i was eleven i watched a movie called 'on the town'...</review>",0,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-4951eb0d-b2fc-494f-936c-12c559aad2e4', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712396, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'This review is positive.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>this movie rates as one of my all time favourite top 10 movies. many people seeing it for the first time and knowing little about many of the themes in the movie probably won't understand why i find it so enthralling so i will try to explain...the movie is very rich in historical detail and cultural insights, and while it has a few minor anachronisms, they are completely forgivable. the story is a retelling of the famous duel between the monk benkei and the young prince yoshitsune on gojo bridge. during the fight according to legend yoshitsune bests benkei and the monk becomes the prince's loyal retainer. this movie is a revision of that story however and involves war, dark prophecy, and political maneuvering.one of the main themes in the movie is 'mappo', which is the prophecy by the buddha that after 1000 years his teachings would fail and the world would fall into chaos. it was believed in heian japan, after the eruption of mt fuji and the civil war between the taira (heike) and the minamoto (genji) that the world would fall into anarchy and everything would collapse. it is a time of demons.next you have the way in which the movie resolves the issue of yoshitsune's sword training by the tenku (raven goblins) of karuma. defeated clans often escaped into the mountains and disguised themselves as demons to scare the locals off. this is said to be where ninja clans began historically. yoshitsune's depiction in gojo nicely accommodates all of this.then there is benkei, and the various strains of buddhism depicted, including a lot of esoteric buddhism of the shingon sect. these are all depicted quite accurately, and just to add a little extra, the movie manages to convey the power of meditation and ki energy in a way that makes it integral to the story, i.e. it uses magic realism to add an extra dimension to the film but does it in such a way as to make it tactical and menacing.all-in-all it is filled with fascinating tidbits and rings surprisingly true-to-life for the period. the scenery and the costuming are also completely unmissable and very authentic. the soundtrack is great, very brooding and ominous. i also thought that the actual acting performances were surprisingly good. benkei is a great brooding anti-hero, shanao (yoshitsune)is depicted as a young man testing his limits and growing increasingly drunk on his own power, and tetsukichi the scavenging sword-smith makes for and interesting depiction of the 'common man' and his less than flattering opinion of the killers who fancy themselves his social betters.as to the plot, to see why it is so good, i really suggest you dig up an old book on japanese history and see how this retelling turns an almost lighthearted robin hood vs little john story into a gory tale of intrigue, violence and infernal karma.</review>",-1,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-0d3ee658-09b9-4db1-be8c-bab6003a2328', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712402, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Based on the movie review, the movie is praised for its historical detail and cultural insights, rich in historical detail, and well-received in the original.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>an on screen caption informs us that it is 'the caribbean sea, may 1891'. a small lifeboat drifts aimlessly at sea containing six convicts from a shipwrecked prison ship, and the ship's doctor a lt. claude de ross (claudio cassinelli). it's night, a strange current takes the boat towards a strange, unnamed and uncharted island. the boat hits some rocks and is torn apart. one of the prisoners is killed by what appears to be a slimy mutant fish-man creature. the next morning morning claude wakes up to find himself washed upon a beach. he finds a pool of white bubbling water and one of the prisoners dead beside it. claude warns another surviving prisoner jose (franco iavarone) not to drink the water as it will kill him. they both eventually meet up with the other surviving prisoners, peter (roberto posse), francois (francesco mazzeri) and skip (giuseppe castellano). francois wanders off on his own to try and catch an animal for food, he finds and kills a large water bird. but in turn he is killed himself by one of the fish-men. claude, jose, peter and skip continue to explore the island as they put francois's death down to an animal attack of some sort. soon after skip is killed when he is impaled on a spike at the bottom of a pit. now only claude, jose and peter are left. they stumble across a cemetery with lots of empty graves and signs of recent black magic rituals. claude spots a snake on a nearby rock, suddenly a shot is heard and the snakes head explodes. a woman on horseback named amanda marvin (barbara bach) is revealed to be claudes saviour. she tells them to leave the island immediately as it is owned by a edmund rackham (richard johnson) and he doesn't like visitors. claude, jose and peter decide to carry on regardless, eventually finding rackham's large house in which they are invited to stay. that night peter goes after amanda and tries to rape her in a swamp, peter quickly becomes food for the fish-men. and a voodoo priestess called shakira (beryl cunningham), who lives with rackham, performs a black magic ritual involving slitting the throat of a chicken at the cemetery. the next day claude and jose decide they should leave the island as they feel very uneasy about rackham and think he is lying to them. jose rides off on horseback and is lost. claude is saved from one of the fish-men by amanda and is again told to leave. claude wants to confront rackham again. rackham reveals that he has a scientist, and amanda's father, named professor ernest marvin (joseph cotten) who he needs to be kept alive. rackham says that the longer ernest stays alive the chances of his own survival will dramatically increase. rackham tells claude his plan. rackham has found the lost city of atlantis at a depth of over 2,000 feet. he is using the fish-men as a means of getting at the lost treasures of atlantis, and needs amanda and her father to control them. he claims the fish-men are descendants of the original inhabitants of atlantis. rackham offers claude a share of the treasure if he will help him keep ernest alive. later claude remembers the name ernest marvin as a scientist who was condemned for experiments transplanting animal organs into human beings. finding ernest's secret laboratory he discovers rackham had lied to him and the fish-men aren't descendants, their actually genetically altered people turned into amphibious creatures by ernest's grotesque experiments! rackham has finally had enough of claude and decides to put an end to his meddling by sticking him in a large tank and slowly filling it with water, as the islands volcano starts to erupt and send lava flying everywhere. rackham wants to leave the island with his treasures and amanda, will claude escape almost certain death to save amanda and get off the island before the erupting volcano tears it apart? directed by sergio martino i really liked this film that mixes various genres. the script by sergio donati is fast paced, interesting and entertaining. the plot is revealed bit by bit, which kept me interested in watching it all the way through. i must say at this point that i've seen the original version and not the one with added scenes inserted for it's us release by roger corman. barbara bach makes for an extremely attractive leading lady, but i hated the way she was introduced by shooting a snakes head off, i thought it was more than a little distasteful. richard johnson makes a great villain and claudio cassinelli a likable hero. the fish-men themselves look a little fake when the camera lingers on them too long but their cool looking and i've seen worse. some of the miniature effects look a little poor too, but overall again i've again seen a lot worse. there's no real gore, violence or nudity in it, but that didn't really bother me actually. the photography by giancarlo ferrando and the production design by massimo antonello geleng combine to create a very nice looking film. period costumes, props and sets like rackham's house and ernest's lab with it's old scientific equipment. the lush green jungle settings also add to the visual splendour on show. i really liked this film and i was entertained throughout it's running time. i'm not sure who i'd recommend it too as it mixes various genres, i guess someone who maybe fancies something a little bit different and generally well made. if you can find a copy give it a go, i'm glad i did.</review>",-1,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-1e92c7a5-f69f-4850-bc3b-81f6a83040ab', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712408, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""This movie appears to be a fantasy film with a mix of science fiction elements.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>this is one of those so-called 'hollywood social commentary' films that wants to have it both ways. and believe me, in this film, both ways are clich√©d and stereotypical. stop-loss is a 21st century john wayne film dealing with some anti-war sentiment but clearly ending on the note that 'if you are a man in today's society, you get your act together and march off to war with your buddies.' in many ways the film was a great sequel to taxi to the dark side as it portrayed a military equally as insane and out of control, a quasi frat party/animal house extravaganza mixed in with a texas red neck world of repressed homo-erotic proofs of masculinity. this movie had it all in one scene after another of clich√©d imagery. and then rebellious military deserter ryan phillippe goes on a 'road trip' with best friend's girlfriend, an artificial storyline manipulation to visit families of dead servicemen, maimed soldiers in military hospitals, etc. and finally to broach the issue of fleeing to canada or mexico. but male honor and patriotism win out in the end, as all freshly scrubbed and handsome, he rides off into the sunset on a bus with his buddies back to iraq and a world that a few minutes before he assured everyone he could never again tolerate. full metal jacket meets sands of iwo jima . but in the end, john wayne rides again! and a hollywood blockbuster ultimately gets to keep both sides of its audience in the palm of its hand¬Ö¬Ö.at least it would like to think so. as far as i was/am concerned, just take me back to the more convincing reality of in the garden of elah.</review>",1,1,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-035e5d28-678f-44d9-93d2-4eda9e444864', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712410, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Based on the content of the review, the sentiment is clearly Negative.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>absolutely dreadful mexican film supposedly based on a short story by edgar allan poe about a newsman wanting to go into the confines of an asylum hidden in the woods to write a story about how it works, etc... when our hero, gaston, is given the grand show by dr. maillard, head of the asylum, we see all kinds of things which are suppose to be horrific, such as men hanging around long in a dungeon, and comedic, such as our hero being joked upon by soldiers as he climbs down a ladder hanging over the side of a building. then there is one sight which might have been meant to be both: a human man dressed as a chicken, yes, that's right a chicken, that pecks around the ground for chicken feed. the scene was to be a comedic highlight of the film, but, at least for me, it was the film's low point and really most revolting when you considered that grown men and women thought this might even be remotely entertaining. ah! that is indeed the real horror that is dr. tarr and his legion of name changes. and that brings me to this salient fact about the film which is most films that undergo multiple title changes usually have some kind of serious problem. yes, this is obvious, but some have distribution problems and others, of which this is one, have numerous title changes so that someone might unsuspectingly buy the same garbage more than once. this is definitely garbage. it has very little going for it. the only performer worth having a look at is claudio brook as the head of the asylum. he is one huge slab of ham as he laughs maniacally, bellows orders, sashays with sword in hand, and praises the chicken. i got so tired of hearing him talk about the 'soothing system' as his means to cure the mentally sick. what a bunch of ludicrosity(hey, a film like this with a script like this deserves this kind of word). it won't take you long to figure out what is going on in the asylum nor will it be any more interesting. cinematic chicken scratch!</review>",1,1,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-2f9e1b64-8d8a-4519-b70f-d94efc062b3b', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712411, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Based on the content of the review, the sentiment is Negative.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>the image of movie studios being financially-driven instead of creatively is not without truth (in fact, it's more true than false). this begs the question why castle rock entertainment allowed kenneth branagh to create a full-length, uncut version of 'hamlet' with his complete creative control among other things. of course, branagh had to agree to some concessions (a star-studded cast, and a 2.5 hour version for wider release), but why would the film studio allow branagh to spend money on a 4 hour version that they knew few would see? could they have, at least in this case, had enough respect for the material and branagh's vision to create something for only a few people? that is not a question that i can answer. whatever the reason, this is a glorious vision for those who are willing to spend four hours watching 'hamlet.' everyone knows the story, so i will not spend much time on that. however, unlike other productions of the play, stage included, this is a completely uncut production, which has never been done before. according to some, shakespeare never intended for the play to be produced uncut, leaving the decision of what to include to the director's discretion. that being said, i have no doubt that had he been able to see it, the bard would have been overjoyed with branagh's production.the film is top-heavy with film stars, although most have mere bit parts. all play their parts equally well. i would have thought branagh too old to play the part of hamlet, and while he still may be, his performance more than makes up for it. hamlet is a complex part, displaying every emotion from grief to anger, happiness to madness, and everything in between. branagh nailed it. derek jacobi is terrific as the wily claudius, whose deception and treachery sets all these things in motion; his unique voice is perfect for the role. julie christie is also very good as gertrude, hamlet's caring mother who doesn't realize what is going on until late in the game.the classical actors are cast in bit parts (judi dench is on for all of 60 seconds and has no lines), but at least they're in it. surprisingly, no one takes this to heart; everyone gives it their all, and it shows. special mention has to go to jack lemmon and billy crystal, who are excellent. robin williams is a little too silly, but he's not bad (his part is pretty small anyway).yet, this is undeniably branagh's show. he adapted one of the most famous plays in history, and in so doing, he took on a whale of a project; it's impressive that he got it done, but the fact that the film is this good is a monumental achievement. what i really liked about this film is that you don't have to be a shakespeare scholar to enjoy it. as most people know, shakespeare is difficult to digest, but branagh and his cast understand this. 'hamlet' is still immensely enjoyable to just sit and listen to the actors deliver the brilliant dialogue and excellent acting.this is a must see for anyone and everyone. it may be four hours long, but it's definitely worth it.</review>",0,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-e36fe023-31e2-4a8f-9452-e4b1818b80ca', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712425, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""This movie review is positive.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>oliver twist was to have controversy as well as success following it after dickens published it in 1837. his picture of life in the urban ghettos was something shocking and new, and his making the central figures of the novel include criminals was another innovation.one day he was walking in london and passed a young woman he had been friendly with. he said hello, but she was rather stiff with him. he could not understand this. a few days later they met again, and he asked what he had done to upset her. 'well, if you must know, i did not like your last novel.', she said. 'really, everyone else thinks highly of it.' he was puzzled: 'what's wrong with it?' 'oh, charles,' she said, 'i'm jewish. how could you make up such a character like fagin?!' he had not expected this: 'well...you know that trial last year of ikey solomon, the thief trainer. he's a model for fagin and he was jewish.' dickens found that did not settle things. 'yes,' she replied, 'he got what he deserved. but charles, they did not call him 'solomon the jew' like you call fagin 'the jew'! moreover, solomon did not plan a murder. fagin does.' dickens had to admit that he might have gotten carried away. he left thinking about what she said.oliver twist was published in several editions. dickens tried to improve on fagin a bit. then he got an idea. he reworked the chapter called 'fagin's last night alive', showing the fears in the man as he faced hanging. he also added some additional details. he let his female friend know about his resolve to change fagin. a day or so later he met her at a friend's house. she looked at him as though he was crazy. 'didn't you like the changes?', he asked. 'charles, what changes - he's still a vile villain called 'the jew'!', she replied. 'yes, i did keep those in, but didn't you see how frightened he was in the death cell in prison.' the young woman had noticed this, but felt that he was so vile he deserved to be suffering such fears. 'ah...then i was right about that...and did you see the little details i added?', he asked. 'what details?', she replied. 'when you first see fagin now he is cooking himself dinner...you read that?', dickens looked at her expecting a sign of recognition. instead the lady looked confused. 'i read he was at the fireplace, but i must have skimmed the passage.' dickens smiled as though he was brilliant, 'he is cooking a pork sausage for his dinner.' 'a what!'she exclaimed. 'he's eating pork, my dear...see - he's not a good jew!' his friend looked at him, shook her head, and to his dismay left their friend's house. she didn't speak to him for years.dickens never totally shook off his own bigotries, but the situation did lead to a partial attempt at amends in his last completed novel. in our mutual friend (1865) he has a minor character, mr. riah, who is used by an unscrupulous landlord to collect high rents from poor tenants. the landlord figures that mr. riah will be blamed because he is jewish.but mr. riah is a good man. he is a very good man. he is a very, very, very, very good man - so good as to be unbelievable. if fagin saw mr. riah in action he'd probably chase him away with a stick.the anti-semitic image of fagin lingers to this day. it is a measure of dickens' genius as a writer that the novel overcomes it. however, in presenting the story on film it still causes problems for screenplay writers and directors: how, after the holocaust, can one do a film treatment of a worthy novel without inflaming bigotry? david lean showed how by having alec guiness appear in one or two scenes showing a human side and in confronting a mob at the end with true dignity. sir carol reed, in his musical version of the novel did it better yet, due to a rewrite in the original musical's script.oliver had been made into a west end musical hit in the middle 1960s, and then taken to broadway where it was again a hit. with a wonderful score by lionel bart, including 'food glorious food', 'i am reviewing the situation', 'consider yourself', 'boy for sale', 'who will buy', 'as long as he needs me', it deserved it's success. reed did well in his casting the roles, including his nephew oliver reed as sykes, ron moody as fagin, mark lester as oliver, jack wild as the dodger, shani wallis as nancy, and harry secombe as mr. bumble. there had been no big musical successes in hollywood for a decade - the last musical to win the best picture oscar had been gigi in 1958. oliver won it in 1968.and fagin - how to handle the eternal problem of the caricature? well in the musical fagin is not captured, tried and executed for the murder that is committed. after all, even lean showed fagin tried to control his confederate in his actions. but here fagin realizes that he is getting too old to depend on this kind of chancy life. although he loses his treasures (those stolen items he kept because he knew their value, and admired their beauty), he decides he can reform. he is allowed to do so, accompanied by his faithful acolyte, the artful dodger. i don't think dickens would have appreciated the change (his female friend might have), but a modern audience certainly accepts it as fitting.</review>",0,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-b3d5b395-f7dc-469a-8d82-5fbd48de6b82', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712427, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""This review highlights Oliver Twist's complex portrayal of characters, particularly with regards to his Jewish background and his treatment of various characters, including Fagin, which caused confusion among readers.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>the only footage of zeppelin i've seen prior to this dvd is 'the song remains the same' movie from 1976. we used to spend hours round a friends house watching this, but i never really liked it and hated the fantasy sequences....so what of this dvd? i didn't know it existed until browsing for the physical graffiti cd.....'when did this come out?' i thoughtfor some reason i thought that page wasn't a great live guitarist, but to say that watching this dvd has changed my opinion is a massive understatement. there's 'white summer' from 1970 - 10 minutes of guitar wizardry.there's an acoustic set from 1975 - 'bron-y-aur stomp' has a brilliant finger-picking improv section.the 'in my time of dying' and 'trampled underfoot' performances (also from '75) are breathtaking - with page and bonham tearing things to pieces like no one else ever has. demonic possessions of rawk!!the magic continues into the knebworth 1979 section. the rendition of 'achillies last stand', considering their various drug-addled states just beggars belief! a song of complex guitar overdubs, page arranged it in a way that lets him just 'punk it out' live - the effect is totally mesmerising. 'in the evening' - i never liked this on disc but it zings along here. 'sick again' - great piece of sleaze-rock. the footage from knebworth is very interesting, cutting between big screen, various rostrums and bootleg footage to great effect.plant is amazing throughout all the performances. page, despite being painfully thin, looks like a six-year old kid having the most fun of his life at the knebworth concert - and makes infectious viewing.one thing that puzzled me - the 'black dog' performance from 1973 sounds very 'camped up'!! robert plant always did love a little 'mince' and those jeans are absolutely ridiculous - and would warrant an arrest nowadays. all very different from the muscle-bound kick-a$$$ studio version.i love this dvd. it has reminded me how good zeppelin were and remain.</review>",0,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-ac007577-642e-45df-ba1b-c10532a1957c', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712431, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Based on the given review, the movie appears to be a high-quality performance piece, with a variety of different performers and a complex guitar arrangement.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>you can't watch a film like peter watkins' 'privilege,' a story of the exploitation of a pop music performer by big business, the state, and even organized religion, without thinking of creatively degenerate commodities like michael jackson or britney spears, who hawk corporate giants like pepsi or some other poison for money. or any number of entertainers, in music or movies, who become tools of political parties or commercial religious interests like scientology and kabbalah. a film like privilege must have seemed almost like science fiction when released in 1967, so fantastic was its premise. today we tend to take celebrity endorsements for granted, giving little thought to its more alarming implications. watkins' vision has not only become reality, we tacitly accept this reality as 'normal.'now consider punishment park. as privilege challenges the viewer to examine what is being sold to us, and why, punishment park demands that we reckon with what is being taken from us, and why. heaven help america, and for that matter the world, if contemporary politicians get their hands on this film. it is already so close to reality, that in viewing it recently, i experienced a genuine, nauseating feeling of anxiety.watkins again skillfully employs a documentary-style narrative. whereas in privilege some rough edges to this technique were apparent, in punishment park it has been honed to sharp, seamless perfection. the sense of realism is enhanced by disarmingly unpretentious, economical, believable portrayals by the entire cast. this is the kind of acting hollywood has completely turned its back on, to its detriment, in favor of cosmetically perfect image projections. the cast has first-rate material to work with in watkins' screenplay. many cinematic visionaries have tried to shake the viewer out of their complacent, false sense of security. no one has ever achieved this result with such stark and chilling accuracy as peter watkins does here.'what seems quite clear now, is that instead of trying to bring the estranged and excluded americans, such as these people, back into the national community, the administration has chosen to accept and exploit the present division within the country, and to side with what it considers is the majority. instead of the politics of reconciliation, it has chosen the politics of polarization.'to paraphrase one of the characters, we don't have to call them pigs because they know what they are. better than we do.</review>",0,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-80aa5d66-9b25-429c-9d95-8b55def087c9', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712466, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""This review is very negative.

The reviewer is also criticizing the film's adherence to a documentary-style narrative, which is criticized by the reviewer as being unrealistic and unpreemptive in comparison to the reality of the situation being portrayed. Additionally, the reviewer is criticizing the cast for not having the same level of acting as Watkins' screenplay, while also pointing out that the film's portrayal of the American public is very different from their reality. Overall, the review is criticizing the film and its portrayal of the situation, and is not positive in any way.""}, 'logprobs': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop'}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 574, 'completion_tokens': 187, 'total_tokens': 761}}"

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>a bunch of mostly obnoxious and grossly unappealing teens go to a creepy, remote, rundown old mortuary located nearby a cemetery to attend an anything-goes all-out halloween party being hosted by freaky occult-obsessed oddball mimi kinkade and her vacuous, boy-hungry bimbette friend linnea quigley. the loutish, profane, beer-guzzling, sex-happy dipstick dimwits hold a s√©ance as a joke (very bad idea, 'cause the desolate old dive is naturally said to be haunted by demonic spirits). of course, that ill-advised s√©ance awakens those decidedly grumpy and hostile evil spirits, who gruesomely kill and possess a majority of the kids, turning them into ugly, fanged, clawed, boil-faced murderous ghouls who wreak the usual grisly havoc throughout the duration of an especially long, dark and harrowing night of pure terror.yep, this is essentially your umpteenth vigorously graphic and unrelenting wall-to-wall cheap shock-ridden 'evil dead' rehash, replete with closed-off, there's no easy way out claustrophobic single self-confined setting, outrageously excessive splatter set pieces, an incessantly pounding hum'n'shiver synthesizer score, a total sense of gloom'n'doom-laden grim nightmarishness, and vibrantly in-your-face manic careening cinematography (the expected headlong rush-inducing hyperactive hand-held camera-work, smooth, sinuous tracking shots, crazily tittled camera angles, even the camera on a dolly doing a gracefully gliding 180 degree figure eight). fortunately, kevin s. tenney's slick, assured, stylish direction keeps the extremely threadbare and derivative proceedings thundering along at a speedy clip; moreover, tenny gives the film an attractive polished look and effectively creates a certain crudely energetic and enthusiastically grotesque spooky ooga-booga carnival funhouse atmosphere.however, steve johnson's marvelously gory and imaginative make-up effects are the true star of the show. bloodthirsty highlights include disgusting fat slob hal havins (who played a similarly irritating obese a**hole role in the immortal 'sorority babes in the slimeball bowl-a-rama' around the same time) having his tongue bitten off, quigley shoving a whole tube of lipstick in one of her breasts (yow!) and gouging a guy's eyes out while she's making love to him (double yow!), a libidinous teen couple getting offed while doing exactly what you think in a coffin (the chick has her neck snapped while the dude has his arm chopped off), kinkade setting her hands on fire, and, in the film's single most nasty scene, a mean old man has his throat slit from the inside out after eating an apple piece laced with razor blades. the trashy'n'thrashy rock score likewise smokes. and then there's kinkade's incredibly wild, sexy and uninhibited demon dance, a sizzling number accompanied by a flickering strobe light and startling jump cuts that kinkade choreographed herself. okay, so this overall doesn't amount to anything more than a completely mindless and pointless, albeit quite nicely mounted and enjoyably vulgar hunk of blithely sleazy fright flick junk, but if you're in the mood for entertainingly brain-dead lowbrow horror scuzziness this cheerfully crass and juvenile dross does the trick just fine.</review>",-1,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-d565baed-4929-4765-93fa-e0112e9813de', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712468, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""The movie appears to be a graphic, unrelenting horror film with disturbing scenes of violence, gore, and psychological horror.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>some people drift through life, moving from one thing or one person to the next without batting an eye; others latch on to a cause, another person or a principle and remain adamant, committed to whatever it is-- and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it. but we're all different, `made of different clay,' as one of the characters in this film puts it, which is what makes life so interesting. some people are just plain crazy, though-- and maybe that's the way you have to be to live among the masses. who knows? who knows what it takes to make things-- life-- work? writer/director lisa krueger takes a shot at it, using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed-- and how one `gets' committed-- and obsession, in `committed,' starring heather graham as a young woman who is adamant, committed, obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy, too. her name is joline, and this is her story.	admittedly, joline has always been a committed person; in work, relationships, in life in general. she's a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what. and when she marries carl (luke wilson), it's forever. the only problem is, someone forgot to tell carl-- and 597 days into the marriage, he's gone; off to `find' himself and figure it all out. when joline realizes he's not coming back, she refuses to give up on him, or their marriage. maybe it's because of that `clay' she's made of. regardless, she leaves their home in new york city and sets off to find him, which she does-- in el paso, texas, of all places. but once she knows where he is, she keeps her distance, giving him his `space' and not even letting him know she's there. she considers carl as being in a `spiritual coma,' and it's her job to keep a `spiritual vigil' over him until he comes to his senses. and while she watches and waits, her life is anything but dull, as she encounters a young woman named carmen (patricia velazquez), a waitress at one of the local eateries; carmen's `grampy,' (alfonso arau), who is something of a mystic; t-bo (mark ruffalo), a truck driver who has issues concerning carl; and neil (goran visnjic) an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy to her. for joline, it's a journey of discovery, during which she learns a lot about carl, but even more about herself.	there's a touch of humor, a touch of romance, and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot. and krueger presents it all extremely well, delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining. her characters are very real people, with all the wants, needs and imperfections that make up the human condition; a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story. we see it from joline's point-of-view, as krueger makes us privy to joline's thoughts and therefore her motivations, which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold. that, along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates, makes for a very effective piece of storytelling. there's an underlying seriousness to this subject matter, but krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy-handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that joline encounters. and the result is a well textured, affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life.	heather graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make joline a character totally of her own creation. she immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable, adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person, and one that is real. and for this film to work, it was imperative that joline be viable and believable-- and graham succeeds on all fronts. her screen presence has never been more alluring, and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes, is enough to draw you in entirely. it's all a part of the character she creates; there's an appeal to joline that exudes from her entire countenance, who she is inside and out. she's a likable, agreeable person, and because you've shared her innermost thoughts, you know who she is. it's a good job all the way around, beginning with the way the character was written, to the way graham brings her so vibrantly to life.	as carmen, patricia velazquez is totally engaging, as well. her performance is very natural and straightforward, and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character. she has a charismatic presence, but is less than flamboyant, and it gives her an aspect that is attractively down-to-earth. she is refreshingly open and up-front; you get the impression that carmen is not one to hold anything back, but is totally honest on all fronts, and that, too, is part of her appeal. and, as with joline, this character is well written, and velazquez brings her convincingly to life.	overall, there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film, including those of luke wilson, casey affleck (as joline's brother, jay), goran visnjic, alfonso arau and especially mark ruffalo as t-bo, who, with very little actual screen time, manages to create a memorable character.	the supporting cast includes kim dickens (jenny), clea du vall (mimi), summer phoenix (meg), art alexakis (new york car thief), dylan baker (carl's editor), and mary kay place (psychiatrist). a film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider the big picture-- reflecting upon who we are, where we're going and what we really need-- `committed' is an enjoyable experience; a ride definitely worth taking. 8/10.</review>",0,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-9f24fd03-9fbd-47f1-a876-68baf10aa4f5', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712503, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""The review provides a positive assessment of the film, highlighting its emotional depth and compelling narrative.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>spunky journalist holly hunter produces investigative news reports for a major news network. she's a motor-mouthed maverick, dazzlingly good at her job and with little time for romantic relationships. enter william hurt and albert brooks, two men who vie for her love.brooks is an old school journalist who adores holly because she represents everything good about journalism. they both believe that the media exists to test the gods, educate the public and fight for truth. children of the sixties, they embody hippie values. they're defenders of the public good. knights who fight valiantly with pen and camera.william hurt, in contrast, is a far more complex character. initially awkward, clumsy and self-depreciating, he gradually reveals himself to be a sexy and manipulative high achiever, skilled at climbing the corporate ladder. unlike holly and brooks, he's symbolic of modern media values: news as spectacle, journalism as entertainment, news anchor as celebrity, truth as subject to editing board. we want to despise him and his blip-time junk food journalism, but we just can't quite manage it. he's playing the game by its own rules. do we condemn him for lacking a moral backbone? do we condemn the game? can the game exist if its rules are disobeyed? how have these rules evolved? this isn't lumet's and chayefsky's 'network', and so the film never bothers to answer or raise these questions. content to keep things on the level of light comedy, it ends with hurt being promoted to london division and brooks being booted to a tiny community network. holly, having rejected both men, remains caught between them. the last bastion of media integrity, this spunky reporter remembers her roots, mourns the loss of brooks and warns herself to be on the guard of future william hurts.it's a cute ending, but compared to 'network' the film seems positively trite. chayefsky's vision is one in which global media, despite its ubiquity, offers less meaningful information. he foresees a world in which globalisation has homogenized cultures, information has become subject to corporatisation and a handful of media monopolies control all international news. this is a world in which the truth is subject to shareholder meetings and economic interests. a world in which viewer ratings determine content and opinion polls dictate top stories. perhaps this is why 'broadcast news', which longs for the glory days of journalism, ends on such a bittersweet note. it knows what the future holds. made in 1987, its been living it for at least a decade.but today, in the digital age, things are even worse. mergers and acquisitions have left a very small number of massive firms dominating the communication landscape. with this has come the hyper-commercialism of content, the barrier between the creative/editorial side and the commercial side all but collapsed. today everyone might be able to start their own blog or website, but these are grass roots affairs. as the communication reach of the individual increases (due to technological progress - email, internet, electricity, air mail etc) the size of the individual's world increases likewise. he must project his voice both further and louder, futilely battling that deafening white noise, the incessant verbal static that is the global community.so ultimately you need two things according to democratic theory. firstly, you need a rigorous coming of people in power and people who want to be in power, both in the private and public sector. secondly, you need a wide range of informed opinions on all important issues of the day. in a democratic society the media system as a whole should produce this sort of culture. unfortunately, the structure we currently have in the global system works directly against the needs of democratic journalism and a democratic society. 8/10 ¬ñ this is lightweight stuff, but a witty script, some funny moments and a brief cameo by jack nicholson, elevate it above most other films about journalism. interestingly, unlike most films about the media, it never dips into satire, and instead plays things as a straight love triangle.worth one viewing.</review>",-1,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-a00951c7-17a4-4438-a23b-f6291bb254ec', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712513, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Based on the content of the review, the film seems to focus on William\'s motivations and the lack of moral integrity of William, which he tries to exploit.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>this cecil b. demille epic of the old west contains what may be jean arthur's finest performance, as a hysterical, eccentric, incurably amoral, but devotedly doting calamity jane. she really pulled it off! gary cooper is at his most taciturn, but manages some occasional pithy sayings: 'the plains are big, but trails cross ... sometimes.' the story is a pastiche to end all pastiches. all the cowboy heroes of western lore seem to be in there somehow except for jesse james. even abraham lincoln opens the story in person (or at least, demille would have us believe so). there is no room for anything so evanescent as subtlety, this is a 'stomp 'em in the face' tale for the masses. a remarkable thing about this film however is that it is a very early full frontal attack on what eisenhower was eventually to name 'the military industrial complex'. it isn't just a story about gun-runners, but about arming anyone for money, and doing so from the heart of washington. but let's not get into politics, let's leave that to demille, who can be guaranteed to be superficial. the chief interest of this film all these years later is that it uses the first film score composed by george antheil, who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography, 'bad boy of music'. antheil seems to have originated 'the big sound' adopted by all subsequent westerns, whereby the plains sing out with the voices and sounds of countless cowboys in the sky, celebrating the open spaces and interweaving common melodies. that is why it does not sound at all unusual, because we have heard it a thousand times. but he seems to have been the first to summon up the combined rustlings of all the sage brush into this symphony of the open skies which has entered into american mythic lore, and given it a soundtrack which has never varied since then, corny as it may be, but doubtless appropriate. it is amusing to see anthony quinn in an early appearance as a cheyenne indian. gabby hayes is in there somewhere, but you miss him in the crowd. gary cooper overtops them all, looming large, - but when did he ever loom small?</review>",-1,0,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-1d45f79a-5896-4ed5-8358-30d7d71021c4', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712515, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Based on the content of the review, the movie appears to have a significant amount of content that is not suitable for a movie review.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>the movie starts with a spiderman spoof which is your introduction to rick riker (played by drake bell of 'drake & josh' fame, personally i'd have given the movie to josh who is much funnier) and the 'rick punchers' joke is lifted right out of airplane so the writers were obviously already scraping the barrel for ideas for this film. rick's class is on a science trip to the amalgamated genetics lab and this is where we get to meet the 1st star name in the film, brent spiner (data in star trek tng) playing dr strom. rick is bitten by a genetically modified dragonfly which is where his powers come from.we meet our next big star names at rick's home, his aunt lucille (marion ross of happy days fame) & uncle albert (leslie nielson of airplane, police squad & naked gun fame). and we're introduced to carlson on the amalgamated board of directors (dan castellaneta from the simpsons) who is then very promptly killed. we're told rick has slept for 5 days & get some cheap, crappy sexually orientated scenes designed to get the teen male audience paying attention. the stephen hawking lookalike's scene is painful to watch and is really a bad idea that doesn't work and isn't remotely funny.we get another spiderman spoof (rick catching the girl and all the planets) but the movie should end right there as jill was hit in the head by a falling bowling ball which would have broken her skull and killed her stone dead. you get to see rick's 1st powers emerge (gripping ability & speed) then his 1st rescue which goes very wrong. we also get an incest reference which is in very poor taste indeed. we get a flashback and a batman spoof in which we discover rick is solely responsible for the death of his parents. spoofing spiderman again ricks uncle is shot with jeffrey tambor (from hellboy) playing the hospital doctor. we then get an x-men spoof (done very badly as patrick stewart is about as white as they come), barry bonds is played by yet another lookalike.we meet invisible girl (played by pamela anderson looking stunning in her costume!). ricks 1st outing in his costume (once he fixes his ability to see & breath through it) is another batman spoof. the tom cruise youtube interview clip is played by yet another lookalike (and not a very good one at that). there are lots of modern references like youtube, facebook & wikipedia all showing that the movie is set in modern day. there's a very weak gay joke (never a good idea to do those either) when jill is helping aunt lucille make thanksgiving dinner and the pissing scene isn't very funny, just infantile.the aunt farting scene isn't particularly funny, just incredibly childish. anyone finding it funny must have a mental age of about 12. she's killed and then we have a really bad necrophilia joke (is there no topic these people won't try to use to get a cheap laugh out of?) at her funeral, and the even worse cremation joke.we get the 2 worst lookalikes in the whole movie (prince charles & nelson mandela) at the awards ceremony and if you didn't already know how infantile or stupidly lowbrow this movie is landers wins the 'douchebag of the year' award. landers is revealed as the hourglass (in a really bad scene where the same girl manages to run past jill twice in the same direction).obviously the hourglass is foiled, jill is rescued from certain death and the only funny scene in the whole movie is the final one.</review>",1,1,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-264679ed-c0b7-4868-82a7-6944b154920a', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712517, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Based on the content of the review, the overall sentiment of the movie review is negative.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>i've been surprised by the enthusiastic response to this film. it seemed dull to me, much as i enjoyed looking at penelope cruz, and the plot details often poorly worked out. it also seemed like an intensely sexist film: if the gender roles were reversed, almost everyone with any sense would be up in arms complaining the movie is intensely misogynist. it's not just that both the principal males are portrayed as complete jerks and sexual predators, but also that the women are portrayed as almost flawless, forming a utopian community which lacks conflict of any kind and which rests on relentless generosity and good humor. utopias are notoriously dull and this one turns out to be no exception. but it's also interesting to notice what happens (and here comes the plot giveaway, though it refers to a very early scene) when the teenage daughter kills her father. (1) her mother rushes to take responsibility for it and(2) the daughter seems to suffer almost no remorse (and in fact her emotional life then disappears from the film). it's not quite a glorified killing, though aldomovar's camera lingers on the blood in a bloodthirsty way, as though it makes an attractive painting, and then it's soaked up and out of sight without bloodying either daughter or mom, neither materially nor emotionally. later the film reveals another killing, again by a woman of a man, , and once again it is a killing which the film implicitly endorses.in short, volver is an ideologically-driven film with an unpleasant and in fact a repugnant ideology, and so i write an ideological critique. but apart from that, it's just not very interesting. it has none of the depth of, say, aldomovar's talk to her, which i loved.</review>",0,1,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-c99bf425-aabf-40b1-b61a-70120191cd11', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712521, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Based on the content of the review, the sentiment is negative.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>one of the more prominent/popular episodes, but clearly one of the worst. a red-shirt female falls for khan (instead of dropping dead - for a change) and then proceeds to betray kirk and the enterprise as if loyalty were a non-existent character trait on the ship. makes one wonder what kind of psychology tests this supposedly brilliant starfleet uses to test people when hiring. we have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in 'wink of an eye', when a red-shirt male takes the enemy's side just because he falls in love! same as in ss. (however, in that episode the betrayal plays a tiny role in the overall plot.) this is very silly because it once again makes kirk's crew seem like a bunch of soft-headed, easy-to-impress morons, who - once they fall in love with the enemy - are capable of doing just about anything. the fact that mcgivers switches back to kirk's side doesn't ameliorate the illogic in any way. lord mcgiveth and the lord mctaketh...why is khan kept behind a regular door when they know he has superior strength? that's one of several st plot-devices that undermine kirk's intelligence. why does khan hold a knife against mccoy's throat? if khan is of such superior intelligence then one would expect him to be more wily with the way he carries himself. and what's with a sikh being played with a latino accent? montalban should have been provided with a vocal coach. i was half-expecting to hear 'the plaaain! the plaaaain!' in the background at any moment. why the hell would kirk (or any ship captain) provide limitless use of the ship's library concerning the innermost technical details of the enterprise to anyone? is the starfleet an institution solely consisting of idiots? ss is a very cartoonish, silly episode, so no wonder trekkies love it. it doesn't have too many sci-fi elements in it, which is what trekkies hate the most. it also figures that the st franchise chose to revive this dull character for the second movie, that way pleasing rabid trekkies, who were so very disappointed with the first movie which - you guessed it - had far too much sci-fi for the average tiny trekkie brain.</review>",0,1,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-2d4b1e71-869a-4d20-8ceb-5fe1126efc54', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712529, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""This review contains a mix of positive and negative sentiment.

Your answer must be either Negative or Positive","<review>the 1930' were a golden age of los angeles with its film industry and great potential of various other possibilities to become rich and famous and happy. people were arriving there hoping to fulfill their dreams. expecting open arms and welcoming offers there were only a few who managed to succeed and find their way to stardom, majority then condemned to live starving, disillusioned and unwanted, searching for a bit of respect in dirty bars and nasty hotel rooms. young italian-american writer arturo bandini arrives to la on a similar quest - to spread his charms around to get one of those beautiful wealthy women and to write an excellent novel that would set him on a career path, having so far written a single short story published in an obscure anthology. wishing to create a romantic masterpiece he seems to be unable to produce anything without experiencing it himself though, occasionally, he sends pieces of magazine stories to a local editor that helps him survive. he is proud to present himself as an italian but deep in his heart he truly feels his italian origin as a burden. the little money and the courage to conquer the world he once had are all long gone and watching his dream turning into a hangover he holds a last single nickel to spend. the coffee she brought him was cold and sour and spitting a curse on her triggers a never-ending relationship of insults, unspoken excuses and a love concealed beneath. camilla being an uneducated girl trying to receive us citizenship through a marriage also carries her heavy cross of a non-perspective racial heritage. though she is much of a stronger and life experienced person her situation as a beautiful mexican woman is much harder to deal with than arturo is able to realize. is it obvious that arturo eventually finds his inspiration to work on the novel? is it possible that their love finally finds its place in the sun? is it likely that their romance takes an unlucky turn?it is very surprising to find out that the chemistry between the two main characters, performed by salma hayek and colin farrell, does not work. the relationship lacks the raw and authentic feelings. hayek though livelier a character compared to farrell's forgot to arm camilla with the passion and strength of her once brilliant character frida. also it is hard to have faith in a character which being intelligent but uneducated and illiterate uses quite difficult vocabulary and complicated sentences. a tougher character of a phil marlowe sort would definitely suit farrell better, though he looks stunning in a period costume, he seems very lost trying to find the fragile world of a twenty-year old dreamer balancing between a hidden love and desire to be true to himself. feeling embarrassed watching the two on the screen is not right. their relationship might have been wild but it is more likely what a thunder and a lightning are without a storm, far from real passion, feelings just described not felt inside. it is very sad that such a potential of an interesting script and good actors was wasted, turned into a grey average of soon-to-be-forgotten.</review>",-1,1,"{'id': 'chatcmpl-995f6278-5e21-445b-ab7e-e1b74a490fc9', 'object': 'chat.completion', 'created': 1746712530, 'model': '/Users/mahat/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bartowski--Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/41ba88dbac95fed2528c92514c131d73eb5a174b/./Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-IQ2_M.gguf', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""Based on the review, the movie appears to be a classic period drama focused on the lives of two Italian-American writers, Arturo Bandini and Camilla.
